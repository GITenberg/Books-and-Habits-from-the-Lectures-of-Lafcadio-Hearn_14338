<h2><a id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>These chapters, for the most part, are reprinted from Lafcadio
Hearn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Interpretations of Literature,&rdquo; 1915,
from his &ldquo;Life and Literature,&rdquo; 1916, and from his
&ldquo;Appreciations of Poetry,&rdquo; 1917. Three chapters appear
here for the first time. They are all taken from the student notes
of Hearn&rsquo;s lectures at the University of Tokyo, 1896-1902,
sufficiently described in the earlier volumes just mentioned. They
are now published in this regrouping in response to a demand for a
further selection of the lectures, in a less expensive volume and
with emphasis upon those papers which illustrate Hearn&rsquo;s
extraordinary ability to interpret the exotic in life and in
books.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that these lectures were delivered to
Japanese students, and that Hearn&rsquo;s purpose was not only to
impart the information about Western literature usually to be found
in our histories and text-books, but much more to explain to the
Oriental mind those peculiarities of our civilization which might
be hard to understand on the further side of the Pacific Ocean. The
lectures are therefore unique, in that they are the first large
attempt by a Western critic to interpret us to the East. That we
shall be deeply concerned in the near future to continue this
interpretation on an even larger scale, no one of us doubts. We
wish we might hope for another genius like Hearn to carry on the
work.</p>
<p>The merit of the chapters printed or reprinted in the present
volume seems to me their power to teach us to imagine our familiar
traditions as foreign and exotic in the eyes of other peoples. We
are accustomed, like every one else, to think of our literature as
the final product of other literatures&mdash;as a terminal in
itself, rather than as a channel through which great potentialities
might flow. Like other men, we are accustomed to think of ourselves
as native, under all circumstances, and of other people at all
times as foreign. While we were staying in their country, did we
not think of the French as foreigners? In these chapters, not
originally intended for us, we have the piquant and salutary
experience of seeing what we look like on at least one occasion
when we are the foreigners; we catch at least a glimpse of what to
the Orient seems exotic in us, and it does us no harm to observe
that the peculiarly Western aspects of our culture are not
self-justifying nor always justifiable when looked at through eyes
not already disposed in their favour. Hearn was one of the most
loyal advocates the West could possibly have sent to the East, but
he was an honest artist, and he never tried to improve his case by
trimming a fact. His interpretation of us, therefore, touches our
sensitiveness in regions&mdash;and in a degree&mdash;which perhaps
his Japanese students were unconscious of; we too marvel as well as
they at his skill in explaining, but we are sensitive to what he
found necessary to explain. We read less for the explanation than
for the inventory of ourselves.</p>
<p>Any interpretation of life which looks closely to the facts will
probably increase our sense of mystery and of strangeness in common
things. If on the other hand it is a theory of experience which
chiefly interests us, we may divert our attention somewhat from the
experience to the theory, leaving the world as humdrum as it was
before we explained it. In that case we must seek the exotic in
remote places and in exceptional conditions, if we are to observe
it at all. But Lafcadio Hearn cultivated in himself and taught his
students to cultivate a quick alertness to those qualities of life
to which we are usually dulled by habit. Education as he conceived
of it had for its purpose what Pater says is the end of philosophy,
to rouse the human spirit, to startle it into sharp and eager
observation. It is a sign that dulness is already spreading in us,
if we must go far afield for the stimulating, the wondrous, the
miraculous. The growing sensitiveness of a sound education would
help us to distinguish these qualities of romance in the very heart
of our daily life. To have so distinguished them is in my opinion
the felicity of Hearn in these chapters. When he was writing of
Japan for European or American readers, we caught easily enough the
exotic atmosphere of the island kingdom&mdash;easily enough, since
it was the essence of a world far removed from ours. The exotic
note is quite as strong in these chapters. We shall begin to
appreciate Hearn&rsquo;s genius when we reflect that here he finds
for us the exotic in ourselves.</p>
<p>The first three chapters deal from different standpoints with
the same subject&mdash;the characteristic of Western civilization
which to the East is most puzzling, our attitude toward women.
Hearn attempted in other essays also to do full justice to this
fascinating theme, but these illustrations are typical of his
method. To the Oriental it is strange to discover a civilization in
which the love of husband and wife altogether supersedes the love
of children for their parents, yet this is the civilization he will
meet in English and in most Western literatures. He can understand
the love of individual women, as we understand the love of
individual men, but he will not easily understand our worship of
women as a sex, our esteem of womankind, our chivalry, our way of
taking woman as a religion. How difficult, then, will he find such
a poem as Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; or most English
novels. He will wonder why the majority of all Western stories are
love stories, and why in English literature the love story takes
place before marriage, whereas in French and other Continental
literatures it usually follows marriage. In Japan marriages are the
concern of the parents; with us they are the concern of the lovers,
who must choose their mates in competition more or less open with
other suitors. No wonder the rivalries and the precarious technique
of love-making are with us an obsession quite exotic to the Eastern
mind. But the Japanese reader, if he would understand us, must also
learn how it is that we have two ways of reckoning with
love&mdash;a realistic way, which occupies itself in portraying
sex, the roots of the tree, as Hearn says, and the idealistic way,
which tries to fix and reproduce the beautiful illusion of either
happy or unhappy passion. And if the Japanese reader has learned
enough of our world to understand all this, he must yet visualize
our social system more clearly perhaps than most of us see it, if
he would know why so many of our love poems are addressed to the
woman we have not yet met. When we begin to sympathize with him in
his efforts to grasp the meaning of our literature, we are at last
awakened ourselves to some notion of what our civilization means,
and as Hearn guides us through the discipline, we realize an exotic
quality in things which formerly we took for granted.</p>
<p>Lecturing before the days of Imagism, before the attention of
many American poets had been turned to Japanese art, Hearn
recognized the scarcity in our literature of those short forms of
verse in which the Greeks as well as the Japanese excel. The
epigram with us is&mdash;or was until recently&mdash;a classical
tradition, based on the brief inscriptions of the Greek anthology
or on the sharp satires of Roman poetry; we had no native turn for
the form as an expression of our contemporary life. Since Hearn
gave his very significant lecture we have discovered for ourselves
an American kind of short poem, witty rather than poetic, and few
verse-forms are now practised more widely among us. Hearn spoke as
a prophet or as a shrewd observer&mdash;which is the same
thing&mdash;when he pointed out the possibility of development in
this field of brevity. He saw that Japan was closer to the Greek
world in this practice than we were, and that our indifference to
the shorter forms constituted a peculiarity which we could hardly
defend. He saw, also, in the work of Heredia, how great an
influence Japanese painting might have on Western literature, even
on those poets who had no other acquaintance with Japan. In this
point also his observation has proved prophetic; the new poets in
America have adopted Japan, as they have adopted Greece, as a
literary theme, and it is somewhat exclusively from the fine arts
of either country that they draw their idea of its life.</p>
<p>The next chapters which are brought together here, consider the
origin and the nature of English and European ethics. Hearn was an
artist to the core, and as a writer he pursued with undivided
purpose that beauty which, as Keats reminded us, is truth. In his
creative moments he was a beauty-lover, not a moralist. But when he
turned critic he at once stressed the cardinal importance of ethics
in the study of literature. The art which strives to end in beauty
will reveal even more clearly than more complex forms of expression
the personality of the artist, and personality is a matter of
character, and character both governs the choice of an ethical
system and is modified by it. Literary criticism as Hearn practised
it is little interested in theology or in the system of morals
publicly professed; it is, however, profoundly concerned with the
ethical principles upon which the artist actually proceeds, the
directions in which his impulses assert themselves, the verdicts of
right and wrong which his temperament pronounces unconsciously, it
may be. Here is the true revelation of character, Hearn thinks,
even though our habitual and instinctive ethics may differ widely
from the ethics we quite sincerely profess. Whether we know it or
not, we are in such matters the children of some educational or
philosophical system, which, preached at our ancestors long ago,
has come at last to envelop us with the apparent naturalness of the
air we breathe. It is a spiritual liberation of the first order, to
envisage such an atmosphere as what it truly is, only a system of
ethics effectively inculcated, and to compare the principles we
live by with those we thought we lived by. Hearn was contriving
illumination for the Japanese when he made his great lecture on the
&ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; identifying in the ancient Northern poem
those precepts which laid down later qualities of English
character; for the Oriental reader it would be easier to identify
the English traits in Thackeray or Dickens or Meredith if he could
first consider them in a dogmatic precept. But the lecture gives
us, I think, an extraordinary insight into ourselves, a power of
self-criticism almost disconcerting as we realize not only the
persistence of ethical ideals in the past, but also the possible
career of new ethical systems as they may permeate the books
written to-day. To what standard will the reader of our
contemporary literature be unconsciously moulded? What account will
be given of literature a thousand years from now, when a later
critic informs himself of our ethics in order to understand more
vitally the pages in which he has been brought up?</p>
<p>Partly to inform his Japanese students still further as to our
ethical tendencies in literature, and partly I think to indulge his
own speculation as to the morality that will be found in the
literature of the future, Hearn gave his remarkable lectures on the
ant-world, following Fabre and other European investigators, and
his lecture on &ldquo;The New Ethics.&rdquo; When he spoke, over
twenty years ago, the socialistic ideal had not gripped us so
effectually as it has done in the last decade, but he had no
difficulty in observing the tendency. Civilization in some later
cycle may wonder at our ambition to abandon individual liberty and
responsibility and to subside into the social instincts of the ant;
and even as it wonders, that far-off civilization may detect in
itself ant-like reactions which we cultivated for it. With this
description of the ant-world it is illuminating to read the two
brilliant chapters on English and French poems about insects.
Against this whole background of ethical theory, I have ventured to
set Hearn&rsquo;s singularly objective account of the Bible.</p>
<p>In the remaining four chapters Hearn speaks of the
&ldquo;Kalevala,&rdquo; of the medi&aelig;val romance &ldquo;Amis
and Amile,&rdquo; of William Cory&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ionica,&rdquo; and
of Theocritus. These chapters deal obviously with literary
influences which have become part and parcel of English poetry, yet
which remain exotic to it, if we keep in mind the Northern stock
which still gives character, ethical and otherwise, to the English
tradition. The &ldquo;Kalevala,&rdquo; which otherwise should seem
nearest to the basic qualities of our poetry, is almost unique, as
Hearn points out, in the extent of its preoccupation with
enchantments and charms, with the magic of words. &ldquo;Amis and
Amile,&rdquo; which otherwise ought to seem more foreign to us, is
strangely close in its glorification of friendship; for chivalry
left with us at least this one great ethical feeling, that to keep
faith in friendship is a holy thing. No wonder Amicus and Amelius
were popular saints. The story implies also, as it falls here in
the book, some illustration of those unconscious or unconsidered
ethical reactions which, as we saw in the chapter on the
&ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; have a lasting influence on our ideals and
on our conduct.</p>
<p>Romanticist though he was, Hearn constantly sought the romance
in the highway of life, the aspects of experience which seem to
perpetuate themselves from age to age, compelling literature to
reassert them under whatever changes of form. To one who has
followed the large mass of his lectures it is not surprising that
he emphasized those ethical positions which are likely to remain
constant, in spite of much new philosophy, nor that he constantly
recurred to such books as Cory&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ionica,&rdquo; or
Lang&rsquo;s translation of Theocritus, in which he found
statements of enduring human attitudes. To him the Greek mind made
a double appeal. Not only did it represent to him the best that has
yet been thought or said in the world, but by its fineness and its
maturity it seemed kindred to the spirit he found in ancient Japan.
Lecturing to Japanese students on Greek poetry as it filters
through English paraphrases and translations, he must have felt
sometimes as we now feel in reading his lectures, that in his
teaching the long migration of the world&rsquo;s culture was
approaching the end of the circuit, and that the earliest
apparition of the East known to most of us was once more arriving
at its starting place, mystery returning to mystery, and its path
at all points mysterious if we rightly observe the miracle of the
human spirit.</p>

<h2>The Insuperable Difficulty</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I wish to speak of the greatest difficulty with which the
Japanese students of English literature, or of almost any Western
literature, have to contend. I do not think that it ever has been
properly spoken about. A foreign teacher might well hesitate to
speak about, it&mdash;because, if he should try to explain it
merely from the Western point of view, he could not hope to be
understood; and if he should try to speak about it from the
Japanese point of view, he would be certain to make various
mistakes and to utter various extravagances. The proper explanation
might be given by a Japanese professor only, who should have so
intimate an acquaintance with Western life as to sympathize with
it. Yet I fear that it would be difficult to find such a Japanese
professor for this reason, that just in proportion as he should
find himself in sympathy with Western life, in that proportion he
would become less and less able to communicate that sympathy to his
students. The difficulties are so great that it has taken me many
years even to partly guess how great they are. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2">[2]</a></span>That they can be
removed at the present day is utterly out of the question. But
something may be gained by stating them even imperfectly. At the
risk of making blunders and uttering extravagances, I shall make
the attempt. I am impelled to do so by a recent conversation with
one of the cleverest students that I ever had, who acknowledged his
total inability to understand some of the commonest facts in
Western life,&mdash;all those facts relating, directly or
indirectly, to the position of woman in Western literature as
reflecting Western life.</p>
<p>Let us clear the ground it once by putting down some facts in
the plainest and lowest terms possible. You must try to imagine a
country in which the place of the highest virtue is occupied, so to
speak, by the devotion of sex to sex. The highest duty of the man
is not to his father, but to his wife; and for the sake of that
woman he abandons all other earthly ties, should any of these
happen to interfere with that relation. The first duty of the wife
may be, indeed, must be, to her child, when she has one; but
otherwise her husband is her divinity and king. In that country it
would be thought unnatural or strange to have one&rsquo;s parents
living in the same house with wife or husband. You know all this.
But it does not explain for you other things, much more difficult
to understand, especially the influence of the abstract idea of
woman upon society at large as well as upon <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3">[3]</a></span>the conduct of
the individual. The devotion of man to woman does not mean at all
only the devotion of husband to wife. It means actually
this,&mdash;that every man is bound by conviction and by opinion to
put all women before himself, simply because they are women. I do
not mean that any man is likely to think of any woman as being his
intellectual and physical superior; but I do mean that he is bound
to think of her as something deserving and needing the help of
every man. In time of danger the woman must be saved first. In time
of pleasure, the woman must be given the best place. In time of
hardship the woman&rsquo;s share of the common pain must be taken
voluntarily by the man as much as possible. This is not with any
view to recognition of the kindness shown. The man who assists a
woman in danger is not supposed to have any claim upon her for that
reason. He has done his duty only, not to her, the individual, but
to womankind at large. So we have arrived at this general fact,
that the first place in all things, except rule, is given to woman
in Western countries, and that it is given almost religiously.</p>
<p>Is woman a religion? Well, perhaps you will have the chance of
judging for yourselves if you go to America. There you will find
men treating women with just the same respect formerly accorded
only to religious dignitaries or to great nobles. Everywhere they
are saluted and helped <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name=
"page4">[4]</a></span>to the best places; everywhere they are
treated as superior beings. Now if we find reverence, loyalty and
all kinds of sacrifices devoted either to a human being or to an
image, we are inclined to think of worship. And worship it is. If a
Western man should hear me tell you this, he would want the
statement qualified, unless he happened to be a philosopher. But I
am trying to put the facts before you in the way in which you can
best understand them. Let me say, then, that the all-important
thing for the student of English literature to try to understand,
is that in Western countries woman is a cult, a religion, or if you
like still plainer language, I shall say that in Western countries
woman is a god.</p>
<p>So much for the abstract idea of woman. Probably you will not
find that particularly strange; the idea is not altogether foreign
to Eastern thought, and there are very extensive systems of
feminine pantheism in India. Of course the Western idea is only in
the romantic sense a feminine pantheism; but the Oriental idea may
serve to render it more comprehensive. The ideas of divine Mother
and divine Creator may be studied in a thousand forms; I am now
referring rather to the sentiment, to the feeling, than to the
philosophical conception.</p>
<p>You may ask, if the idea or sentiment of divinity attaches to
woman in the abstract, what about woman in the
concrete&mdash;individual woman? <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page5" name="page5">[5]</a></span>Are women individually
considered as gods? Well, that depends on how you define the word
god. The following definition would cover the ground, I
think:&mdash;&ldquo;Gods are beings superior to man, capable of
assisting or injuring him, and to be placated by sacrifice and
prayer.&rdquo; Now according to this definition, I think that the
attitude of man towards woman in Western countries might be very
well characterized as a sort of worship. In the upper classes of
society, and in the middle classes also, great reverence towards
women is exacted. Men bow down before them, make all kinds of
sacrifices to please them, beg for their good will and their
assistance. It does not matter that this sacrifice is not in the
shape of incense burning or of temple offerings; nor does it matter
that the prayers are of a different kind from those pronounced in
churches. There is sacrifice and worship. And no saying is more
common, no truth better known, than that the man who hopes to
succeed in life must be able to please the women. Every young man
who goes into any kind of society knows this. It is one of the
first lessons that he has to learn. Well, am I very wrong in saying
that the attitude of men towards women in the West is much like the
attitude of men towards gods?</p>
<p>But you may answer at once,&mdash;How comes it, if women are
thus reverenced as you say, that men of the lower classes beat and
ill-treat their wives <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name=
"page6">[6]</a></span>in those countries? I must reply, for the
same reason that Italian and Spanish sailors will beat and abuse
the images of the saints and virgins to whom they pray, when their
prayer is not granted. It is quite possible to worship an image
sincerely and to seek vengeance upon it in a moment of anger. The
one feeling does not exclude the other. What in the higher classes
may be a religion, in the lower classes may be only a superstition,
and strange contradictions exist, side by side, in all forms of
superstition. Certainly the Western working man or peasant does not
think about his wife or his neighbour&rsquo;s wife in the
reverential way that the man of the superior class does. But you
will find, if you talk to them, that something of the reverential
idea is there; it is there at least during their best moments.</p>
<p>Now there is a certain exaggeration in what I have said. But
that is only because of the somewhat narrow way in which I have
tried to express a truth. I am anxious to give you the idea that
throughout the West there exists, though with a difference
according to class and culture, a sentiment about women quite as
reverential as a sentiment of religion. This is true; and not to
understand it, is not to understand Western literature.</p>
<p>How did it come into existence? Through many causes, some of
which are so old that we can not know anything about them. This
feeling did not belong to the Greek and Roman civilization
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7">[7]</a></span>but
it belonged to the life of the old Northern races who have since
spread over the world, planting their ideas everywhere. In the
oldest Scandinavian literature you will find that women were
thought of and treated by the men of the North very much as they
are thought of and treated by Englishmen of to-day. You will find
what their power was in the old sagas, such as the Njal-Saga, or
&ldquo;The Story of Burnt Njal.&rdquo; But we must go much further
than the written literature to get a full knowledge of the origin
of such a sentiment. The idea seems to have existed that woman was
semi-divine, because she was the mother, the creator of man. And we
know that she was credited among the Norsemen with supernatural
powers. But upon this Northern foundation there was built up a
highly complex fabric of romantic and artistic sentiment. The
Christian worship of the Virgin Mary harmonized with the Northern
belief. The sentiment of chivalry reinforced it. Then came the
artistic resurrection of the Renaissance, and the new reverence for
the beauty of the old Greek gods, and the Greek traditions of
female divinities; these also coloured and lightened the old
feeling about womankind. Think also of the effect with which
literature, poetry and the arts have since been cultivating and
developing the sentiment. Consider how the great mass of Western
poetry is love poetry, and the greater part of Western fiction love
stories.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name=
"page8">[8]</a></span>Of course the foregoing is only the vaguest
suggestion of a truth. Really my object is not to trouble you at
all about the evolutional history of the sentiment, but only to ask
you to think what this sentiment means in literature. I am not
asking you to sympathize with it, but if you could sympathize with
it you would understand a thousand things in Western books which
otherwise must remain dim and strange. I am not expecting that you
can sympathize with it. But it is absolutely necessary that you
should understand its relation to language and literature.
Therefore I have to tell you that you should try to think of it as
a kind of religion, a secular, social, artistic religion, not to be
confounded with any national religion. It is a kind of race feeling
or race creed. It has not originated in any sensuous idea, but in
some very ancient superstitious idea. Nearly all forms of the
highest sentiment and the highest faith and the highest art have
had their beginnings in equally humble soil.</p>

<h2>On Love in English Poetry</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature
the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the
extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in
fiction and in poetry. Indeed, by this time I have begun to feel a
little astonished at it myself. Of course, before I came to this
country it seemed to me quite natural that love should be the chief
subject of literature; because I did not know anything about any
other kind of society except Western society. But to-day it really
seems to me a little strange. If it seems strange to me, how much
more ought it to seem strange to you! Of course, the simple
explanation of the fact is that marriage is the most important act
of man&rsquo;s life in Europe or America, and that everything
depends upon it. It is quite different on this side of the world.
But the simple explanation of the difference is not enough. There
are many things to be explained. Why should not only the novel
writers but all the poets make love the principal subject of their
work? I never knew, because I never thought, how much English
literature was saturated with the subject of love <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10">[10]</a></span>until I
attempted to make selections of poetry and prose for class
use&mdash;naturally endeavouring to select such pages or poems as
related to other subjects than passion. Instead of finding a good
deal of what I was looking for, I could find scarcely anything. The
great prose writers, outside of the essay or history, are nearly
all famous as tellers of love stories. And it is almost impossible
to select half a dozen stanzas of classic verse from Tennyson or
Rossetti or Browning or Shelley or Byron, which do not contain
anything about kissing, embracing, or longing for some imaginary or
real beloved. Wordsworth, indeed, is something of an exception; and
Coleridge is most famous for a poem which contains nothing at all
about love. But exceptions do not affect the general rule that love
is the theme of English poetry, as it is also of French, Italian,
Spanish, or German poetry. It is the dominant motive.</p>
<p>So with the English novelists. There have been here also a few
exceptions&mdash;such as the late Robert Louis Stevenson, most of
whose novels contain little about women; they are chiefly novels or
romances of adventure. But the exceptions are very few. At the
present time there are produced almost every year in England about
a thousand new novels, and all of these or nearly all are love
stories. To write a novel without a woman in it would be a
dangerous undertaking; in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the
book would not sell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name=
"page11">[11]</a></span>Of course all this means that the English
people throughout the world, as readers, are chiefly interested in
the subject under discussion. When you find a whole race interested
more in one thing than in anything else, you may be sure that it is
so because the subject is of paramount importance in the life of
the average person. You must try to imagine then, a society in
which every man must choose his wife, and every woman must choose
her husband, independent of all outside help, and not only choose
but obtain if possible. The great principle of Western society is
that competition rules here as it rules in everything else. The
best man&mdash;that is to say, the strongest and cleverest&mdash;is
likely to get the best woman, in the sense of the most beautiful
person. The weak, the feeble, the poor, and the ugly have little
chance of being able to marry at all. Tens of thousands of men and
women can not possibly marry. I am speaking of the upper and middle
classes. The working people, the peasants, the labourers, these
marry young; but the competition there is just the same&mdash;just
as difficult, and only a little rougher. So it may be said that
every man has a struggle of some kind in order to marry, and that
there is a kind of fight or contest for the possession of every
woman worth having. Taking this view of Western society not only in
England but throughout all Europe, you will easily be able to see
why the Western public have reason to be more interested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name=
"page12">[12]</a></span>in literature which treats of love than in
any other kind of literature.</p>
<p>But although the conditions that I have been describing are
about the same in all Western countries, the tone of the literature
which deals with love is not at all the same. There are very great
differences. In prose they are much more serious than in poetry;
because in all countries a man is allowed, by public opinion, more
freedom in verse than in prose. Now these differences in the way of
treating the subject in different countries really indicate
national differences of character. Northern love stories and
Northern poetry about love are very serious; and these authors are
kept within fixed limits. Certain subjects are generally forbidden.
For example, the English public wants novels about love, but the
love must be the love of a girl who is to become somebody&rsquo;s
wife. The rule in the English novel is to describe the pains,
fears, and struggles of the period before marriage&mdash;the
contest in the world for the right of marriage. A man must not
write a novel about any other point of love. Of course there are
plenty of authors who have broken this rule but the rule still
exists. A man may represent a contest between two women, one good
and one bad, but if the bad woman is allowed to conquer in the
story, the public will growl. This English fashion has existed
since the eighteenth century. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"
name="page13">[13]</a></span>since the time of Richardson, and is
likely to last for generations to come.</p>
<p>Now this is not the rule at all which governs making of novels
in France. French novels generally treat of the relations of women
to the world and to lovers, after marriage; consequently there is a
great deal in French novels about adultery, about improper
relations between the sexes, about many things which the English
public would not allow. This does not mean that the English are
morally a better people than the French or other Southern races.
But it does mean that there are great differences in the social
conditions. One such difference can be very briefly expressed. An
English girl, an American girl, a Norwegian, a Dane, a Swede, is
allowed all possible liberty before marriage. The girl is told,
&ldquo;You must be able to take care of yourself, and not do
wrong.&rdquo; After marriage there is no more such liberty. After
marriage in all Northern countries a woman&rsquo;s conduct is
strictly watched. But in France, and in Southern countries, the
young girl has no liberty before marriage. She is always under the
guard of her brother, her father, her mother, or some experienced
relation. She is accompanied wherever she walks. She is not allowed
to see her betrothed except in the presence of witnesses. But after
marriage her liberty begins. Then she is told for the first time
that she must take care of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"
name="page14">[14]</a></span>herself. Well, you will see that the
conditions which inspire the novels, in treating of the subjects of
love and marriage, are very different in Northern and in Southern
Europe. For this reason alone the character of the novel produced
in England could not be the same.</p>
<p>You must remember, however, that there are many other reasons
for this difference&mdash;reasons of literary sentiment. The
Southern or Latin races have been civilized for a much longer time
than the Northern races; they have inherited the feelings of the
ancient world, the old Greek and Roman world, and they think still
about the relation of the sexes in very much the same way that the
ancient poets and romance writers used to think. And they can do
things which English writers can not do, because their language has
power of more delicate expression.</p>
<p>We may say that the Latin writers still speak of love in very
much the same way that it was considered before Christianity. But
when I speak of Christianity I am only referring to an historical
date. Before Christianity the Northern races also thought about
love very much in the same way that their best poets do at this
day. The ancient Scandinavian literature would show this. The
Viking, the old sea-pirate, felt very much as Tennyson or as
Meredith would feel upon this subject; he thought of only one kind
of love as real&mdash;that which ends in marriage, the affection
between <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name=
"page15">[15]</a></span>husband and wife. Anything else was to him
mere folly and weakness. Christianity did not change his sentiment
on this subject. The modern Englishman, Swede, Dane, Norwegian, or
German regards love in exactly that deep, serious, noble way that
his pagan ancestors did. I think we can say that different races
have differences of feeling on sexual relations, which differences
are very much older than any written history. They are in the blood
and soul of a people, and neither religion nor civilization can
utterly change them.</p>
<p>So far I have been speaking particularly about the differences
in English and French novels; and a novel is especially a
reflection of national life, a kind of dramatic narration of truth,
in the form of a story. But in poetry, which is the highest form of
literature, the difference is much more observable. We find the
Latin poets of to-day writing just as freely on the subject of love
as the old Latin poets of the age of Augustus, while Northern poets
observe with few exceptions great restraint when treating of this
theme. Now where is the line to be drawn? Are the Latins right? Are
the English right? How are we to make a sharp distinction between
what is moral and good and what is immoral and bad in treating
love-subjects?</p>
<p>Some definition must be attempted.</p>
<p>What is meant by love? As used by Latin writers the word has a
range of meanings, from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name=
"page16">[16]</a></span>that of the sexual relation between insects
or animals up to the highest form of religious emotion, called
&ldquo;The love of God.&rdquo; I need scarcely say that this
definition is too loose for our use. The English word, by general
consent, means both sexual passion and deep friendship. This again
is a meaning too wide for our purpose. By putting the adjective
&ldquo;true&rdquo; before love, some definition is attempted in
ordinary conversation. When an Englishman speaks of &ldquo;true
love,&rdquo; he usually means something that has no passion at all;
he means a perfect friendship which grows up between man and wife
and which has nothing to do with the passion which brought the pair
together. But when the English poet speaks of love, he generally
means passion, not friendship. I am only stating very general
rules. You see how confusing the subject is, how difficult to
define the matter. Let us leave the definition alone for a moment,
and consider the matter philosophically.</p>
<p>Some very foolish persons have attempted even within recent
years to make a classification of different kinds of
love&mdash;love between the sexes. They talk about romantic love,
and other such things. All that is utter nonsense. In the meaning
of sexual affection there is only one kind of love, the natural
attraction of one sex for them other; and the only difference in
the highest for of this attraction and the lowest is this, that in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name=
"page17">[17]</a></span>the nobler nature a vast number of moral,
aesthetic, and ethical sentiments are related to the passion, and
that in lower natures those sentiments are absent. Therefore we may
say that even in the highest forms of the sentiment there is only
one dominant feeling, complex though it be, the desire for
possession. What follows the possession we may call love if we
please; but it might better be called perfect friendship and
sympathy. It is altogether a different thing. The love that is the
theme of poets in all countries is really love, not the friendship
that grows out of it.</p>
<p>I suppose you know that the etymological meaning of
&ldquo;passion&rdquo; is &ldquo;a state of suffering.&rdquo; In
regard to love, the word has particular significance to the Western
mind, for it refers to the time of struggle and doubt and longing
before the object is attained. Now how much of this passion is a
legitimate subject of literary art?</p>
<p>The difficulty may, I think, be met by remembering the
extraordinary character of the mental phenomena which manifest
themselves in the time of passion. There is during that time a
strange illusion, an illusion so wonderful that it has engaged the
attention of great philosophers for thousands of years; Plato, you
know, tried to explain it in a very famous theory. I mean the
illusion that seems to charm, or rather, actually does charm the
senses of a man at a certain time. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page18" name="page18">[18]</a></span>To his eye a certain face has
suddenly become the most beautiful object in the world. To his ears
the accents of one voice become the sweetest of all music. Reason
has nothing to do with this, and reason has no power against the
enchantment. Out of Nature&rsquo;s mystery, somehow or other, this
strange magic suddenly illuminates the senses of a man; then
vanishes again, as noiselessly as it came. It is a very ghostly
thing, and can not be explained by any theory not of a very ghostly
kind. Even Herbert Spencer has devoted his reasoning to a new
theory about it. I need not go further in this particular than to
tell you that in a certain way passion is now thought to have
something to do with other lives than the present; in short, it is
a kind of organic memory of relations that existed in thousands and
tens of thousands of former states of being. Right or wrong though
the theories may be, this mysterious moment of love, the period of
this illusion, is properly the subject of high poetry, simply
because it is the most beautiful and the most wonderful experience
of a human life. And why?</p>
<p>Because in the brief time of such passion the very highest and
finest emotions of which human nature is capable are brought into
play. In that time more than at any other hour in life do men
become unselfish, unselfish at least toward one human being. Not
only unselfishness but self-sacrifice is a desire peculiar to the
period. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name=
"page19">[19]</a></span>young man in love is not merely willing to
give away everything that he possesses to the person beloved; he
wishes to suffer pain, to meet danger, to risk his life for her
sake. Therefore Tennyson, in speaking of that time, beautifully
said:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with
might,</p>
<p>Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass&rsquo;d in music
out of sight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unselfishness is, of course, a very noble feeling, independently
of the cause. But this is only one of the emotions of a higher
class when powerfully aroused. There is pity, tenderness&mdash;the
same kind of tenderness that one feels toward a child&mdash;the
love of the helpless, the desire to protect. And a third sentiment
felt at such a time more strongly than at any other, is the
sentiment of duty; responsibilities moral and social are then
comprehended in a totally new way. Surely none can dispute these
facts nor the beauty of them.</p>
<p>Moral sentiments are the highest of all; but next to them the
sentiment of beauty in itself, the artistic feeling, is also a very
high form of intellectual and even of secondary moral experience.
Scientifically there is a relation between the beautiful and the
good, between the physically perfect and the ethically perfect. Of
course it is not absolute. There is nothing absolute in this world.
But the relation exists. Whoever can comprehend <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20">[20]</a></span>the highest
form of one kind of beauty must be able to comprehend something of
the other. I know very well that the ideal of the love-season is an
illusion; in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of the thousand
the beauty of the woman is only imagined. But does that make any
possible difference? I do not think that it does. To imagine beauty
is really to see it&mdash;not objectively, perhaps, but
subjectively beyond all possibility of doubt. Though you see the
beauty only in your mind, in your mind it is; and in your mind its
ethical influence must operate. During the time that a man worships
even imaginary bodily beauty, he receives some secret glimpse of a
higher kind of beauty&mdash;beauty of heart and mind. Was there
ever in this world a real lover who did not believe the woman of
his choice to be not only the most beautiful of mortals, but also
the best in a moral sense? I do not think that there ever was.</p>
<p>The moral and the ethical sentiments of a being thus aroused
call into sudden action all the finer energies of the man&mdash;the
capacities for effort, for heroism, for high-pressure work of any
sort, mental or physical, for all that requires quickness in
thought and exactitude in act. There is for the time being a sense
of new power. Anything that makes strong appeal to the best
exercise of one&rsquo;s faculties is beneficent and, in most cases,
worthy of reverence. Indeed, it is in the short season of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name=
"page21">[21]</a></span>which I am speaking that we always discover
the best of everything in the character of woman or of man. In that
period the evil qualities, the ungenerous side, is usually kept as
much out of sight as possible.</p>
<p>Now for all these suggested reasons, as for many others which
might be suggested, the period of illusion in love is really the
period which poets and writers of romance are naturally justified
in describing. Can they go beyond it with safety, with propriety?
That depends very much upon whether they go up or down. By going up
I mean keeping within the region of moral idealism. By going down I
mean descending to the level of merely animal realism. In this
realism there is nothing deserving the highest effort of art of any
sort.</p>
<p>What is the object of art? Is it not, or should it not be, to
make us imagine better conditions than that which at present exist
in the world, and by so imagining to prepare the way for the coming
of such conditions? I think that all great art has done this. Do
you remember the old story about Greek mothers keeping in their
rooms the statue of a god or a man, more beautiful than anything
real, so that their imagination might be constantly influenced by
the sight of beauty, and that they might perhaps be able to bring
more beautiful children into the world? Among the Arabs, mothers
also do something of this kind, only, as <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22">[22]</a></span>they have no
art of imagery, they go to Nature herself for the living image.
Black luminous eyes are beautiful, and wives keep in their tents a
little deer, the gazelle, which is famous for the brilliancy and
beauty of its eyes. By constantly looking at this charming pet the
Arab wife hopes to bring into the world some day a child with eyes
as beautiful as the eyes of the gazelle. Well, the highest function
of art ought to do for us, or at least for the world, what the
statue and the gazelle were expected to do for Grecian and Arab
mothers&mdash;to make possible higher conditions than the existing
ones.</p>
<p>So much being said, consider again the place and the meaning of
the passion of love in any human life. It is essentially a period
of idealism, of imagining better things and conditions than are
possible in this world. For everybody who has been in love has
imagined something higher than the possible and the present. Any
idealism is a proper subject for art. It is not at all the same in
the case of realism. Grant that all this passion, imagination, and
fine sentiment is based upon a very simple animal impulse. That
does not make the least difference in the value of the highest
results of that passion. We might say the very same thing about any
human emotion; every emotion can be evolutionally traced back to
simple and selfish impulses shared by man with the lower animals.
But, because an apple tree or a pear tree <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23">[23]</a></span>happens to
have its roots in the ground, does that mean that its fruits are
not beautiful and wholesome? Most assuredly we must not judge the
fruit of the tree from the unseen roots; but what about turning up
the ground to look at the roots? What becomes of the beauty of the
tree when you do that? The realist&mdash;at least the French
realist&mdash;likes to do that. He likes to bring back the
attention of his reader to the lowest rather than to the highest,
to that which should be kept hidden, for the very same reason that
the roots of a tree should be kept underground if the tree is to
live.</p>
<p>The time of illusion, then, is the beautiful moment of passion;
it represents the artistic zone in which the poet or romance writer
ought to be free to do the very best that he can. He may go beyond
that zone; but then he has only two directions in which he can
travel. Above it there is religion, and an artist may, like Dante,
succeed in transforming love into a sentiment of religious ecstasy.
I do not think that any artist could do that to-day; this is not an
age of religious ecstasy. But upwards there is no other way to go.
Downwards the artist may travel until he finds himself in hell.
Between the zone of idealism and the brutality of realism there are
no doubt many gradations. I am only indicating what I think to be
an absolute truth, that in treating of love the literary master
should keep to the period of illusion, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page24" name="page24">[24]</a></span>and that to go below it is a
dangerous undertaking. And now, having tried to make what are
believed to be proper distinctions between great literature on this
subject and all that is not great, we may begin to study a few
examples. I am going to select at random passages from English
poets and others, illustrating my meaning.</p>
<p>Tennyson is perhaps the most familiar to you among poets of our
own time; and he has given a few exquisite examples of the ideal
sentiment in passion. One is a concluding verse in the beautiful
song that occurs in the monodrama of &ldquo;Maud,&rdquo; where the
lover, listening in the garden, hears the steps of his beloved
approaching.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She is coming, my own, my sweet,</p>
<p class="i2">Were it ever so airy a tread,</p>
<p>My heart would hear her and beat,</p>
<p class="i2">Were it earth in an earthy bed;</p>
<p>My dust would hear her and beat,</p>
<p class="i2">Had I lain for a century dead;</p>
<p>Would start and tremble under her feet,</p>
<p class="i2">And blossom in purple and red.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a very fine instance of the purely idea
emotion&mdash;extravagant, if you like, in the force of the imagery
used, but absolutely sincere and true; for the imagination of love
is necessarily extravagant. It would be quite useless to ask
whether the sound of a girl&rsquo;s footsteps could really waken a
dead man; we know that love can fancy such things quite naturally,
not in one country only but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"
name="page25">[25]</a></span>everywhere. An Arabian poem written
long before the time of Mohammed contains exactly the same thought
in simpler words; and I think that there are some old Japanese
songs containing something similar. All that the statement really
means is that the voice, the look, the touch, even the footstep of
the woman beloved have come to possess for the lover a significance
as great as life and death. For the moment he knows no other
divinity; she is his god, in the sense that her power over him has
become infinite and irresistible.</p>
<p>The second example may be furnished from another part of the
same composition&mdash;the little song of exaltation after the
promise to marry has been given.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>O let the solid ground</p>
<p class="i2">Not fail beneath my feet</p>
<p>Before my life has found</p>
<p class="i2">What some have found so sweet;</p>
<p>Then let come what come may,</p>
<p>What matter if I go mad,</p>
<p>I shall have had my day.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Let the sweet heavens endure,</p>
<p class="i2">Not close and darken above me</p>
<p>Before I am quite, quite sure</p>
<p class="i2">That there is one to love me;</p>
<p>Then let come what come may</p>
<p>To a life that has been so sad,</p>
<p>I shall have had my day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name=
"page26">[26]</a></span>The feeling of the lover is that no matter
what happens afterwards, the winning of the woman is enough to pay
for life, death, pain, or anything else. One of the most remarkable
phenomena of the illusion is the supreme indifference to
consequences&mdash;at least to any consequences which would not
signify moral shame or loss of honour, Of course the poet is
supposed to consider the emotion only in generous natures. But the
subject of this splendid indifference has been more wonderfully
treated by Victor Hugo than by Tennyson&mdash;as we shall see later
on, when considering another phase of the emotion. Before doing
that, I want to call your attention to a very charming treatment of
love&rsquo;s romance by an American. It is one of the most delicate
of modern compositions, and it is likely to become a classic, as it
has already been printed in four or five different anthologies. The
title is &ldquo;Atalanta&rsquo;s Race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First let me tell you the story of Atalanta, so that you will be
better able to see the fine symbolism of the poem. Atalanta, the
daughter of a Greek king, was not only the most beautiful of
maidens, but the swiftest runner in the world. She passed her time
in hunting, and did not wish to marry. But as many men wanted to
marry her, a law was passed that any one who desired to win her
must run a race with her. If he could beat her in running, then she
promised to marry him, but if he lost the race, he was to be
killed. Some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name=
"page27">[27]</a></span>say that the man was allowed to run first,
and that the girl followed with a spear in her hand and killed him
when she overtook him. There are different accounts of the contest.
Many suitors lost the race and were killed. But finally young man
called Hippomenes obtained from the Goddess of Love three golden
apples, and he was told that if he dropped these apples while
running, the girl would stop to pick them up, and that in this way
he might be able to win the race. So he ran, and when he found
himself about to be beaten, he dropped one apple. She stopped to
pick it up and thus he gained a little. In this way he won the race
and married Atalanta. Greek mythology says that afterwards she and
her husband were turned into lions because they offended the gods;
however, that need not concern us here. There is a very beautiful
moral in the old Greek story, and the merit of the American
composition is that its author, Maurice Thompson, perceived this
moral and used it to illustrate a great philosophical truth.</p>

<p>When Spring grows old, and sleepy winds</p>
<p class="i2">Set from the South with odours sweet,</p>

<p class="i2">Speed down dusk aisles on shining feet.</p>
<p>She throws a kiss and bids me run,</p>
<p class="i2">In whispers sweet as roses&rsquo; breath;</p>
<p>I know I cannot win the race,</p>
<p>And at the end, I know, is death.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name=
"page28">[28]</a></span>
<p>But joyfully I bare my limbs,</p>
<p class="i2">Anoint me with the tropic breeze,</p>
<p>And feel through every sinew run</p>
<p class="i2">The vigour of Hippomenes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>O race of love! we all have run</p>
<p class="i2">Thy happy course through groves of Spring,</p>
<p>And cared not, when at last we lost,</p>
<p class="i2">For life or death, or anything!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a few thoughts here requiring a little comment. You
know that the Greek games and athletic contests were held in the
fairest season, and that the contestants were stripped. They were
also anointed with oil, partly to protect the skin against sun and
temperature and partly to make the body more supple. The poet
speaks of the young man as being anointed by the warm wind of
Spring, the tropic season of life. It is a very pretty fancy. What
he is really telling us is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no more Greek games, but the race of love is
still run to-day as in times gone by; youth is the season, and the
atmosphere of youth is the anointing of the contestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the moral of the piece is its great charm, the poetical
statement of a beautiful and a wonderful fact. In almost every life
there is a time when we care for only one person, and suffer much
for that person&rsquo;s sake; yet in that period we do not care
whether we suffer or die, and in after life, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29">[29]</a></span>when we look
back at those hours of youth, we wonder at the way in which we then
felt. In European life of to-day the old Greek fable is still true;
almost everybody must run Atalanta&rsquo;s race and abide by the
result.</p>
<p>One of the delightful phases of the illusion of love is the
sense of old acquaintance, the feeling as if the person loved had
been known and loved long ago in some time and place forgotten. I
think you must have observed, many of you, that when the senses of
sight and hearing happen to be strongly stirred by some new and
most pleasurable experience, the feeling of novelty is absent, or
almost absent. You do not feel as if you were seeing or hearing
something new, but as if you saw or heard something that you knew
all about very long ago. I remember once travelling with a Japanese
boy into a charming little country town in Shikoku&mdash;and
scarcely had we entered the main street, than he cried out:
&ldquo;Oh, I have seen this place before!&rdquo; Of course he had
not seen it before; he was from Osaka and had never left the great
city until then. But the pleasure of his new experience had given
him this feeling of familiarity with the unfamiliar. I do not
pretend to explain this familiarity with the new&mdash;it is a
great mystery still, just as it was a great mystery to the Roman
Cicero. But almost everybody that has been in love has probably had
the same feeling during a moment or two&mdash;the feeling &ldquo;I
have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name=
"page30">[30]</a></span>known that woman before,&rdquo; though the
where and the when are mysteries. Some of the modern poets have
beautifully treated this feeling. The best example that I can give
you is the exquisite lyric by Rossetti entitled &ldquo;Sudden
Light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I have been here before,</p>
<p class="i2">But when or how I cannot tell:</p>
<p>I know the grass beyond the door,</p>
<p class="i2">The sweet keen smell,</p>
<p>The sighing sound, the lights around the shore.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>You have been mine before,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">How long ago I may not know:</p>
<p>But just when at that swallow&rsquo;s soar</p>
<p class="i2">Your neck turn&rsquo;d so,</p>
<p>Some veil did fall,&mdash;I knew it all of yore.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Has this been thus before?</p>
<p class="i2">And shall not thus time&rsquo;s eddying flight</p>
<p>Still with our lives our loves restore</p>
<p class="i2">In death&rsquo;s despite,</p>
<p>And day and night yield one delight once more?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think you will acknowledge that this is very pretty; and the
same poet has treated the idea equally well in other poems of a
more complicated kind. But another poet of the period was haunted
even more than Rossetti by this idea&mdash;Arthur
O&rsquo;Shaughnessy. Like Rossetti he was a great lover, and very
unfortunate in his love; and he wrote his poems, now famous, out of
the pain and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name=
"page31">[31]</a></span>regret that was in his heart, much as
singing birds born in cages are said to sing better when their eyes
are put out. Here is one example:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Along the garden ways just now</p>
<p class="i2">I heard the flowers speak;</p>
<p>The white rose told me of your brow,</p>
<p class="i2">The red rose of your cheek;</p>
<p>The lily of your bended head,</p>
<p class="i2">The bindweed of your hair:</p>
<p>Each looked its loveliest and said</p>
<p class="i2">You were more fair.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I went into the woods anon,</p>
<p class="i2">And heard the wild birds sing</p>
<p>How sweet you were; they warbled on,</p>
<p class="i2">Piped, trill&rsquo;d the self-same thing.</p>
<p>Thrush, blackbird, linnet, without pause</p>
<p class="i2">The burden did repeat,</p>
<p>And still began again because</p>
<p class="i2">You were more sweet.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And then I went down to the sea,</p>
<p class="i2">And heard it murmuring too,</p>
<p>Part of an ancient mystery,</p>
<p class="i2">All made of me and you:</p>
<p>How many a thousand years ago</p>
<p class="i2">I loved, and you were sweet&mdash;</p>
<p>Longer I could not stay, and so</p>
<p class="i2">I fled back to your feet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last stanza especially expresses the idea that I have been
telling you about; but in a poem <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page32" name="page32">[32]</a></span>entitled &ldquo;Greater
Memory&rdquo; the idea is much more fully expressed. By
&ldquo;greater memory&rdquo; you must understand the memory beyond
this life into past stages of existence. This piece has become a
part of the nineteenth century poetry that will live; and a few of
the best stanzas deserve to be quoted,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In the heart there lay buried for years</p>
<p>Love&rsquo;s story of passion and tears;</p>
<p>Of the heaven that two had begun</p>
<p class="i2">And the horror that tore them apart;</p>
<p>When one was love&rsquo;s slayer, but one</p>
<p class="i2">Made a grave for the love in his heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The long years pass&rsquo;d weary and lone</p>

<p>Then one day from its innermost place,</p>
<p class="i2">In the shamed and ruin&rsquo;d love&rsquo;s
stead,</p>
<p>Love arose with a glorified face,</p>
<p class="i2">Like an angel that comes from the dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>It uplifted the stone that was set</p>
<p>On that tomb which the heart held yet;</p>
<p>But the sorrow had moulder&rsquo;d within</p>
<p class="i2">And there came from the long closed door</p>
<p>A dear image, that was not the sin</p>
<p class="i2">Or the grief that lay buried before.</p>
</div>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="stanza">
<p>There was never the stain of a tear</p>
<p>On the face that was ever so dear;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas the same in each lovelier way;</p>
<p class="i2">&rsquo;Twas old love&rsquo;s holier part,</p>
<p>And the dream of the earliest day</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name=

<p>It was knowledge of all that had been</p>

<p>&rsquo;Twas the word which the lips could not say</p>
<p class="i2">To redeem or recover the past.</p>
<p>It was more than was taken away</p>
<p class="i2">Which the heart got back at the last.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The passion that lost its spell,</p>
<p>The rose that died where it fell,</p>
<p>The look that was look&rsquo;d in vain,</p>
<p class="i2">The prayer that seemed lost evermore,</p>
<p>They were found in the heart again,</p>
<p class="i2">With all that the heart would restore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Put into less mystical language the legend is this: A young man
and a young woman loved each other for a time; then they were
separated by some great wrong&mdash;we may suppose the woman was
untrue. The man always loved her memory, in spite of this wrong
which she had done. The two died and were buried; hundreds and
hundreds of years they remained buried, and the dust of them mixed
with the dust of the earth. But in the perpetual order of things, a
pure love never can die, though bodies may die and pass away. So
after many generations the pure love which this man had for a bad
woman was born again in the heart of another man&mdash;the same,
yet not the same. And the spirit of the woman that long ago had
done the wrong, also found incarnation again; and the two meeting,
are drawn to each other by what people call love, but what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name=
"page34">[34]</a></span>is really Greater Memory, the recollection
of past lives. But now all is happiness for them, because the
weaker and worse part of each has really died and has been left
hundreds of years behind, and only the higher nature has been born
again. All that ought not to have been is not; but all that ought
to be now is. This is really an evolutionary teaching, but it is
also poetical license, for the immoral side of mankind does not by
any means die so quickly as the poet supposes. It is perhaps a
question of many tens of thousands of years to get rid of a few of
our simpler faults. Anyway, the fancy charms us and tempts us
really to hope that these things might be so.</p>
<p>While the poets of our time so extend the history of a love
backwards beyond this life, we might expect them to do the very
same thing in the other direction. I do not refer to reunion in
heaven, or anything of that sort, but simply to affection continued
after death. There are some very pretty fancies of the kind. But
they can not prove to you quite so interesting as the poems which
treat the recollection of past life. When we consider the past
imaginatively, we have some ground to stand on. The past has
been&mdash;there is no doubt about that. The fact that we are at
this moment alive makes it seem sufficiently true that we were
alive thousands or millions of years ago. But when we turn to the
future for poetical inspiration, the case is very different. There
we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name=
"page35">[35]</a></span>must imagine without having anything to
stand upon in the way of experience. Of course if born again into a
body we could imagine many things; but there is the ghostly
interval between death and birth which nobody is able to tell us
about. Here the poet depends upon dream experiences, and it is of
such an experience that Christina Rossetti speaks in her beautiful
poem entitled &ldquo;A Pause.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>They made the chamber sweet with flowers and leaves,</p>
<p class="i2">And the bed sweet with flowers on which I lay,</p>
<p class="i2">While my soul, love-bound, loitered on its way.</p>
<p>I did not hear the birds about the eaves,</p>
<p>Nor hear the reapers talk among the sheaves:</p>
<p>Only my soul kept watch from day to day,</p>
<p class="i2">My thirsty soul kept watch for one away:&mdash;</p>
<p>Perhaps he loves, I thought, remembers, grieves.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>At length there came the step upon the stair,</p>
<p class="i2">Upon the lock the old familiar hand:</p>
<p>Then first my spirit seemed to scent the air</p>
<p class="i2">Of Paradise; then first the tardy sand</p>
<p>Of time ran golden; and I felt my hair</p>
<p class="i2">Put on a glory, and my soul expand.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The woman is dead. In the room where her body died, flowers have
been placed, offerings to the dead. Also there are flowers upon the
bed. The ghost of the woman observes all this, but she does not
feel either glad or sad because of it; she is thinking only of the
living lover, who was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name=
"page36">[36]</a></span>not there when she died, but far away. She
wants to know whether he really loved her, whether he will really
be sorry to hear that she is dead. Outside the room of death the
birds are singing; in the fields beyond the windows peasants are
working, and talking as they work. But the ghost does not listen to
these sounds. The ghost remains in the room only for love&rsquo;s
sake; she can not go away until the lover comes. At last she hears
him coming. She knows the sound of the step; she knows the touch of
the hand upon the lock of the door. And instantly, before she sees
him at all, she first feels delight. Already it seems to her that
she can smell the perfume of the flowers of heaven; it then seems
to her that about her head, as about the head of an angel, a circle
of glory is shaping itself, and the real heaven, the Heaven of
Love, is at hand.</p>
<p>How very beautiful this is. There is still one line which
requires a separate explanation&mdash;I mean the sentence about the
sands of time running golden. Perhaps you may remember the same
simile in Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in His glowing
hands;</p>
<p>Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here time is identified with the sand of the hour glass, and the
verb &ldquo;to run&rdquo; is used because this verb commonly
expresses the trickling of the sand <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page37" name="page37">[37]</a></span>from the upper part of the
glass into the lower. In other words, fine sand &ldquo;runs&rdquo;
just like water. To say that the sands of time run golden, or
become changed into gold, is only a poetical way of stating that
the time becomes more than happy&mdash;almost heavenly or divine.
And now you will see how very beautiful the comparison becomes in
this little poem about the ghost of the woman waiting for the
coming step of her lover.</p>
<p>Several other aspects of the emotion may now be considered
separately. One of these, an especially beautiful one, is memory.
Of course, there are many aspects of love&rsquo;s memories, some
all happiness, others intensely sorrowful&mdash;the memory of a
walk, a meeting, a moment of good-bye. Such memories occupy a very
large place in the treasure house of English love poems. I am going
to give three examples only, but each of a different kind. The
first poet that I am going to mention is Coventry Patmore. He wrote
two curious books of poetry, respectively called &ldquo;The Angel
in the House&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Unknown Eros.&rdquo; In the
first of these books he wrote the whole history of his courtship
and marriage&mdash;a very dangerous thing for a poet to do, but he
did it successfully. The second volume is miscellaneous, and
contains some very beautiful things. I am going to quote only a few
lines from the piece called &ldquo;Amelia.&rdquo; This piece is the
story of an evening spent with a sweetheart, and the lines
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name=
"page38">[38]</a></span>which I am quoting refer to the moment of
taking the girl home. They are now rather famous:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&hellip; To the dim street</p>
<p>I led her sacred feet;</p>
<p>And so the Daughter gave,</p>
<p>Soft, moth-like, sweet,</p>
<p>Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk,</p>
<p>Back to her Mother, anxious in the dusk.</p>
<p>And now &ldquo;Good Night!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Why should the poet speak of the girl in this way? Why does he
call her feet sacred? She has just promised to marry him; and now
she seems to him quite divine. But he discovers very plain words
with which to communicate his finer feelings to the reader. The
street is &ldquo;dim&rdquo; because it is night; and in the night
the beautifully dressed maiden seems like a splendid moth&mdash;the
name given to night butterflies in England. In England the moths
are much more beautiful than the true butterflies; they have wings
of scarlet and purple and brown and gold. So the comparison, though
peculiarly English, is very fine. Also there is a suggestion of the
soundlessness of the moth&rsquo;s flight. Now &ldquo;showy as
damask rose&rdquo; is a striking simile only because the
damask-rose is a wonderfully splendid flower&mdash;richest in
colour of all roses in English gardens. &ldquo;Shy as musk&rdquo;
is rather a daring simile. &ldquo;Musk&rdquo; is a perfume used by
English as well as Japanese ladies, but there is no <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39">[39]</a></span>perfume which
must be used with more discretion, carefulness. If you use ever so
little too much, the effect is not pleasant. But if you use exactly
the proper quantity, and no more, there is no perfume which is more
lovely. &ldquo;Shy as musk&rdquo; thus refers to that kind of
girlish modesty which never commits a fault even by the measure of
a grain&mdash;beautiful shyness incapable of being anything but
beautiful. Nevertheless the comparison must be confessed one which
should be felt rather than explained.</p>
<p>The second of the three promised quotations shall be from Robert
Browning. There is one feeling, not often touched upon by poets,
yet peculiar to lovers, that is here treated&mdash;the desire when
you are very happy or when you are looking at anything attractive
to share the pleasure of the moment with the beloved. But it seldom
happens that the wish and the conditions really meet. Referring to
this longing Browning made a short lyric that is now a classic; it
is among the most dainty things of the century.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Never the time and the place</p>
<p class="i2">And the loved one all together!</p>
<p>This path&mdash;how soft to pace!</p>
<p class="i2">This May&mdash;what magic weather!</p>
<p>Where is the loved one&rsquo;s face?</p>
<p>In a dream that loved one&rsquo;s face meets mine,</p>
<p>But the house is narrow, the place is bleak</p>
<p>Where, outside, rain and wind combine</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40">[40]</a></span>
<p>With a furtive ear, if I try to speak,</p>
<p>With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,</p>
<p>With a malice that marks each word, each sign!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Never can we have things the way we wish in this world&mdash;a
beautiful day, a beautiful place, and the presence of the beloved
all at the same time. Something is always missing; if the place be
beautiful, the weather perhaps is bad. Or if the weather and the
place both happen to be perfect, the woman is absent. So the poet
finding himself in some very beautiful place, and remembering this,
remembers also the last time that he met the woman beloved. It was
a small dark house and chilly; outside there was rain and storm;
and the sounds of the wind and of the rain were as the sounds of
people secretly listening, or sounds of people trying to look in
secretly through the windows. Evidently it was necessary that the
meeting should be secret, and it was not altogether as happy as
could have been wished.</p>
<p>The third example is a very beautiful poem; we must content
ourselves with an extract from it. It is the memory of a betrothal
day, and the poet is Frederick Tennyson. I suppose you know that
there were three Tennysons, and although Alfred happened to be the
greatest, all of them were good poets.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>It is a golden morning of the spring,</p>
<p class="i2">My cheek is pale, and hers is warm with bloom,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41">[41]</a></span>
<p class="i2">And we are left in that old carven room,</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p>My love, my life, my bride!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr class="short" /></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And silence o&rsquo;er us, after that great bliss,</p>
<p class="i2">Fell like a welcome shadow&mdash;and I heard</p>
<p class="i2">The far woods sighing, and a summer bird</p>
<p>Singing amid the trees;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sweet bird&rsquo;s happy song, that streamed around,</p>
<p class="i2">The murmur of the woods, the azure skies,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She sleeps in peace beneath the chancel stone,</p>
<p class="i2">But ah! so clearly is the vision seen,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This is great art in its power of picturing a memory of the
heart. Let us notice some of the beauties. The lover is pale
because he is afraid, anxious; he is going to ask a question and he
does not know how she may answer him. All this was <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42">[42]</a></span>long ago,
years and years ago, but the strong emotions of that morning leave
their every detail painted in remembrance, with strange vividness
After all those years the man still recollects the appearance of
the room, the sunshine entering and the crimson rose looking into
the room from the garden, with bees humming round it. Then after
the question had been asked and happily answered, neither could
speak for joy; and because of the silence all the sounds of nature
outside became almost painfully distinct. Now he remembers how he
heard in that room the sound of the wind in far-away trees, the
singing of a bird&mdash;he also remembers all the colours and the
lights of the day. But it was very, very long ago, and she is dead.
Still, the memory is so clear and bright in his heart that it is as
if time had stood still, or as if she had come back from the grave.
Only one thing assures him that it is but a memory&mdash;he is
alone.</p>
<p>Returning now to the subject of love&rsquo;s illusion in itself,
let me remind you that the illusion does not always pass
away&mdash;not at all. It passes away in every case of happy union,
when it has become no longer necessary to the great purposes of
nature. But in case of disappointment, loss, failure to win the
maiden desired, it often happens that the ideal image never fades
away, but persistently haunts the mind through life, and is capable
thus of making even the most successful life unhappy. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43">[43]</a></span>Sometimes the
result of such disappointment may be to change all a man&rsquo;s
ideas about the world, about life, about religion; and everything
remains darkened for him. Many a young person disappointed in love
begins to lose religious feeling from that moment, for it seems to
him, simply because he happens to be unfortunate, that the universe
is all wrong. On the other hand the successful lover thinks that
the universe is all right; he utters his thanks to the gods, and
feels his faith in religion and human nature greater than before. I
do not at this moment remember any striking English poem
illustrating this fact; but there is a pretty little poem in French
by Victor Hugo showing well the relation between successful love
and religious feeling in simple minds. Here is an English
translation of it. The subject is simply a walk at night, the
girl-bride leaning upon the arm of her husband; and his memory of
the evening is thus expressed:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The trembling arm I pressed</p>
<p>Fondly; our thoughts confessed</p>
<p class="i2">Love&rsquo;s conquest tender;</p>
<p>God filled the vast sweet night,</p>
<p>Love filled our hearts; the light</p>
<p class="i2">Of stars made splendour.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Even as we walked and dreamed,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt heaven and earth, it seemed</p>
<p class="i2">Our souls were speaking;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44">[44]</a></span>
<p>The stars looked on thy face;</p>
<p>Thine eyes through violet space</p>
<p class="i2">The stars were seeking.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And from the astral light</p>
<p>Feeling the soft sweet night</p>
<p class="i2">Thrill to thy soul,</p>
<p>Thou saidst: &ldquo;O God of Bliss,</p>
<p>Lord of the Blue Abyss,</p>
<p class="i2">Thou madest the whole!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And the stars whispered low</p>

<p class="i2">Thou madest Beauty!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of course here the religious feeling itself is part of the
illusion, but it serves to give great depth and beauty to simple
feeling. Besides, the poem illustrates one truth very
forcibly&mdash;namely, that when we are perfectly happy all the
universe appears to be divine and divinely beautiful; in other
words, we are in heaven. On the contrary, when we are very unhappy
the universe appears to be a kind of hell, in which there is no
hope, no joy, and no gods to pray to.</p>
<p>But the special reason I wished to call attention to Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s lyric is that it has that particular quality called by
philosophical critics &ldquo;cosmic emotion.&rdquo; Cosmic emotion
means the highest quality <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45"
name="page45">[45]</a></span>of human emotion. The word
&ldquo;cosmos&rdquo; signifies the universe&mdash;not simply this
world, but all the hundred millions of suns and worlds in the known
heaven. And the adjective &ldquo;cosmic&rdquo; means, of course,
&ldquo;related to the whole universe.&rdquo; Ordinary emotion may
be more than individual in its relations. I mean that your feelings
may be moved by the thought or the perception of something relating
not only to your own life but also to the lives of many others. The
largest form of such ordinary emotion is what would be called
national feeling, the feeling of your own relation to the whole
nation or the whole race. But there is higher emotion even than
that. When you think of yourself emotionally not only in relation
to your own country, your own nation, but in relation to all
humanity, then you have a cosmic emotion of the third or second
order. I say &ldquo;third or second,&rdquo; because whether the
emotion be second or third rate depends very much upon your
conception of humanity as One. But if you think of yourself in
relation not to this world only but to the whole universe of
hundreds of millions of stars and planets&mdash;in relation to the
whole mystery of existence&mdash;then you have a cosmic emotion of
the highest order. Of course there are degrees even in this; the
philosopher or the metaphysician will probably have a finer quality
of cosmic emotion than the poet or the artist is able to have. But
lovers very often, according to their degree <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46">[46]</a></span>of
intellectual culture, experience a kind of cosmic emotion; and
Victor Hugo&rsquo;s little poem illustrates this. Night and the
stars and the abyss of the sky all seem to be thrilling with love
and beauty to the lover&rsquo;s eyes, because he himself is in a
state of loving happiness; and then he begins to think about his
relation to the universal life, to the supreme mystery beyond all
Form and Name.</p>
<p>A third or fourth class of such emotion may be illustrated by
the beautiful sonnet of Keats, written not long before his death.
Only a very young man could have written this, because only a very
young man loves in this way&mdash;but how delightful it is! It has
no title.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</p>
<p>And watching, with eternal lids apart,</p>
<p class="i2">Like nature&rsquo;s patient, sleepless Eremite,</p>
<p>The moving waters at their priest-like task</p>
<p class="i2">Of pure ablution round earth&rsquo;s human
shores,</p>
<p>Or gazing on new soft-fallen mask</p>
<p class="i2">Of snow upon the mountains and the moors&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>No&mdash;yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,</p>
<p class="i2">Pillow&rsquo;d upon my fair love&rsquo;s ripening
breast,</p>
<p>To feel forever its soft fall and swell,</p>
<p class="i2">Awake forever in a sweet unrest,</p>
<p>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,</p>
<p>And so live ever&mdash;or else swoon to death.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Tennyson has charmingly represented a lover <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47">[47]</a></span>wishing that
he were a necklace of his beloved, or her girdle, or her earring;
but that is not a cosmic emotion at all. Indeed, the idea of
Tennyson&rsquo;s pretty song was taken from old French and English
love songs of the peasants&mdash;popular ballads. But in this
beautiful sonnet of Keats, where the lover wishes to be endowed
with the immortality and likeness of a star only to be forever with
the beloved, there is something of the old Greek thought which
inspired the beautiful lines written between two and three thousand
years ago, and translated by J.A. Symonds:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Gazing on stars, my Star? Would that I were the welkin,</p>
<p>Starry with myriad eyes, ever to gave upon thee!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But there is more than the Greek beauty of thought in
Keats&rsquo;s sonnet, for we find the poet speaking of the exterior
universe in the largest relation, thinking of the stars watching
forever the rising and the falling of the sea tides, thinking of
the sea tides themselves as continually purifying the world, even
as a priest purifies a temple. The fancy of the boy expands to the
fancy of philosophy; it is a blending of poetry, philosophy, and
sincere emotion.</p>
<p>You will have seen by the examples which we have been reading
together that English love poetry, like Japanese love poetry, may
be divided into many branches and classified according to the range
of subject from the very simplest utterance <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48">[48]</a></span>of feeling up
to that highest class expressing cosmic emotion. Very rich the
subject is; the student is only puzzled where to choose. I should
again suggest to you to observe the value of the theme of illusion,
especially as illustrated in our examples. There are indeed
multitudes of Western love poems that would probably appear to you
very strange, perhaps very foolish. But you will certainly
acknowledge that there are some varieties of English love poetry
which are neither strange nor foolish, and which are well worth
studying, not only in themselves but in their relation to the
higher forms of emotional expression in all literature. Out of love
poetry belonging to the highest class, much can be drawn that would
serve to enrich and to give a new colour to your own literature of
emotion.</p>

<h2>The Ideal Woman in English Poetry</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>As I gave already in this class a lecture on the subject of love
poetry, you will easily understand that the subject of the present
lecture is not exactly love. It is rather about love&rsquo;s
imagining of perfect character and perfect beauty. The part of it
to which I think your attention could be deservedly given is that
relating to the imagined wife of the future, for this is a subject
little treated of in Eastern poetry. It is a very pretty subject.
But in Japan and other countries of the East almost every young man
knows beforehand whom he is likely to marry. Marriage is arranged
by the family: it is a family matter, indeed a family duty and not
a romantic pursuit. At one time, very long ago, in Europe,
marriages were arranged in much the same way. But nowadays it may
be said in general that no young man in England or America can even
imagine whom he will marry. He has to find his wife for himself;
and he has nobody to help him; and if he makes a mistake, so much
the worse for him. So to Western imagination the wife of the future
is a mystery, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name=
"page50">[50]</a></span>a romance, an anxiety&mdash;something to
dream about and to write poetry about.</p>
<p>This little book that I hold in my hand is now very rare. It is
out of print, but it is worth mentioning to you because it is the
composition of an exquisite man of letters, Frederick
Locker-Lampson, best of all nineteenth century writers of society
verse. It is called &ldquo;Patchwork.&rdquo; Many years ago the
author kept a kind of journal in which he wrote down or copied all
the most beautiful or most curious things which he had heard or
which he had found in books. Only the best things remained, so the
value of the book is his taste in selection. Whatever
Locker-Lampson pronounced good, the world now knows to have been
exactly what he pronounced, for his taste was very fine. And in
this book I find a little poem quoted from Mr. Edwin Arnold, now
Sir Edwin. Sir Edwin Arnold is now old and blind, and he has not
been thought of kindly enough in Japan, because his work has not
been sufficiently known. Some people have even said his writings
did harm to Japan, but I want to assure you that such statements
are stupid lies. On the contrary, he did for Japan whatever good
the best of his talent as a poet and the best of his influence as a
great journalist could enable him to do. But to come back to our
subject: when Sir Edwin was a young student he had his dreams about
marriage like other young English students, and he put one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name=
"page51">[51]</a></span>of them into verse, and that verse was at
once picked out by Frederick Locker-Lampson for his little book of
gems. Half a century has passed since then; but
Locker-Lampson&rsquo;s judgment remains good, and I am going to put
this little poem first because it so well illustrates the subject
of the lecture. It is entitled &ldquo;A Ma Future.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where waitest thou,</p>
<p class="i2">Lady, I am to love? Thou comest not,</p>
<p class="i2">Thou knowest of my sad and lonely lot&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>It is the May,</p>
<p class="i2">And each sweet sister soul hath found its

<p class="i2">Only we two seek fondly each the other,</p>
<p>And seeking still delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where art thou, sweet?</p>
<p class="i2">I long for thee as thirsty lips for streams,</p>
<p class="i2">O gentle promised angel of my dreams,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">We cannot live apart, must meeting be</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">That crimsons all the quiet college gloom,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This is, of course, addressed to the spirit of the unknown
future wife. It is pretty, though it is only the work of a young
student. But some one hundred years before, another student&mdash;a
very great student, Richard Crashaw,&mdash;had a fancy of the same
kind, and made verses about it which are famous. You will find
parts of his poem about the imaginary wife in the ordinary
anthologies, but not all of it, for it is very long. I will quote
those verses which seem to me the best.</p>
<h4>Wishes</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whoe&rsquo;er she be,</p>
<p>That not impossible She,</p>
<p>That shall command my heart and me;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where&rsquo;er she lie,</p>
<p>Locked up from mortal eye,</p>
<p>In shady leaves of Destiny;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p>Of studied Fate stand forth,</p>
<p>And teach her fair steps to our earth;</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53">[53]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Till that divine</p>
<p>Idea take a shrine</p>
<p>Of crystal flesh, through which to shine;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Meet you her, my wishes,</p>
<p>Bespeak her to my blisses,</p>
<p>And be ye called my absent kisses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poet is supposing that the girl whom he is to marry may not
as yet even have been born, for though men in the world of
scholarship can marry only late in life, the wife is generally
quite young. Marriage is far away in the future for the student,
therefore these fancies. What he means to say in short is about
like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my wishes, go out of my heart and look for the being
whom I am destined to marry&mdash;find the soul of her, whether
born or yet unborn, and tell that soul of the love that is waiting
for it.&rdquo; Then he tries to describe the imagined woman he
hopes to find:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I wish her beauty</p>
<p>That owes not all its duty</p>
<p>To gaudy &rsquo;tire or glist&rsquo;ring shoe-tie.</p>

<p>Something more than</p>

<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>
<p>There is much more, but the best of the thoughts are here. They
are not exactly new thoughts, nor strange thoughts, but they are
finely expressed in a strong and simple way.</p>
<p>There is another composition on the same
subject&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name=
"page55">[55]</a></span>the imaginary spouse, the destined one. But
this is written by a woman, Christina Rossetti.</p>
<h4>Somewhere or Other</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Somewhere or other there must surely be</p>
<p class="i2">The face not seen, the voice not heard,</p>
<p>The heart that not yet&mdash;never yet&mdash;ah me!</p>
<p class="i2">Made answer to my word.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Somewhere or other, may be near or far;</p>
<p class="i2">Past land and sea, clean out of sight;</p>
<p>Beyond the wondering moon, beyond the star</p>
<p class="i2">That tracks her night by night.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Somewhere or other, may be far or near;</p>
<p class="i2">With just a wall, a hedge between;</p>
<p>With just the last leaves of the dying year,</p>
<p class="i2">Fallen on a turf grown green.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And that turf means of course the turf of a grave in the
churchyard. This poem expresses fear that the destined one never
can be met, because death may come before the meeting time. All
through the poem there is the suggestion of an old belief that for
every man and for every woman there must be a mate, yet that it is
a chance whether the mate will ever be found.</p>
<p>You observe that all of these are ghostly poems, whether
prospective or retrospective. Here is another prospective poem:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name=
"page56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h4>Amaturus</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Somewhere beneath the sun,</p>
<p class="i2">These quivering heart-strings prove it,</p>
<p>Somewhere there must be one</p>
<p class="i2">Made for this soul, to move it;</p>
<p>Someone that hides her sweetness</p>
<p class="i2">From neighbors whom she slights,</p>
<p>Nor can attain completeness,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor give her heart its rights;</p>
<p>Someone whom I could court</p>
<p class="i2">With no great change of manner,</p>
<p>Still holding reason&rsquo;s fort</p>
<p class="i2">Though waving fancy&rsquo;s banner;</p>
<p>A lady, not so queenly</p>

<p>Yet born to smile serenely</p>
<p class="i2">Like those that rule the land;</p>
<p>Noble, but not too proud;</p>
<p class="i2">With soft hair simply folded,</p>
<p>And bright face crescent-browed</p>
<p class="i2">And throat by Muses moulded;</p>

<p>Fair hand, whose touches thrill,</p>
<p class="i2">Like golden rod of wonder,</p>
<p>Which Hermes wields at will</p>
<p class="i2">Spirit and flesh to sunder.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57">[57]</a></span>
<p>Forth, Love, and find this maid,</p>
<p class="i2">Wherever she be hidden;</p>
<p>Speak, Love, be not afraid,</p>
<p class="i2">But plead as thou art bidden;</p>
<p>And say, that he who taught thee</p>
<p class="i2">His yearning want and pain,</p>
<p>Too dearly dearly bought thee</p>
<p class="i2">To part with thee in vain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These lines are by the author of that exquisite little book
&ldquo;Ionica&rdquo;&mdash;a book about which I hope to talk to you
in another lecture. His real name was William Cory, and he was long
the head-master of an English public school, during which time he
composed and published anonymously the charming verses which have
made him famous&mdash;modelling his best work in close imitation of
the Greek poets. A few expressions in these lines need explanation.
For instance, the allusion to Hermes and his rod. I think you know
that Hermes is the Greek name of the same god whom the Romans
called Mercury,&mdash;commonly represented as a beautiful young
man, naked and running quickly, having wings attached to the
sandals upon his feet. Runners used to pray to him for skill in
winning foot races. But this god had many forms and many
attributes, and one of his supposed duties was to bring the souls
of the dead into the presence of the king of Hades. So you will see
some pictures of him standing before the throne of the king of the
Dead, and behind him <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name=
"page58">[58]</a></span>a long procession of shuddering ghosts. He
is nearly always pictured as holding in his hands a strange sceptre
called the <em>caduceus</em>, a short staff about which two little
serpents are coiled, and at the top of which is a tiny pair of
wings. This is the golden rod referred to by the poet; when Hermes
touched anybody with it, the soul of the person touched was obliged
immediately to leave the body and follow after him. So it is a very
beautiful stroke of art in this poem to represent the touch of the
hand of great love as having the magical power of the golden rod of
Hermes. It is as if the poet were to say: &ldquo;Should she but
touch me, I know that my spirit would leap out of my body and
follow after her.&rdquo; Then there is the expression
&ldquo;crescent-browed.&rdquo; It means only having beautifully
curved eyebrows&mdash;arched eyebrows being considered particularly
beautiful in Western countries.</p>
<p>Now we will consider another poem of the ideal. What we have
been reading referred to ghostly ideals, to memories, or to hopes.
Let us now see how the poets have talked about realities. Here is a
pretty thing by Thomas Ashe. It is entitled &ldquo;Pansie&rdquo;;
and this flower name is really a corruption of a French word
&ldquo;Penser,&rdquo; meaning a thought. The flower is very
beautiful, and its name is sometimes given to girls, as in the
present case.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59">[59]</a></span>
<h4>Meet We No Angels, Pansie?</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Came, on a Sabbath noon, my sweet,</p>
<p class="i2">In white, to find her lover;</p>
<p>The grass grew proud beneath her feet,</p>
<p class="i2">The green elm-leaves above her:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Meet we no angels, Pansie?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She said, &ldquo;We meet no angels now;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i2">And soft lights stream&rsquo;d upon her;</p>
<p>And with white hand she touch&rsquo;d a bough;</p>
<p class="i2">She did it that great honour:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">What! meet no angels, Pansie?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>O sweet brown hat, brown hair, brown eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">Down-dropp&rsquo;d brown eyes, so tender!</p>
<p>Then what said I? Gallant replies</p>
<p class="i2">Seem flattery, and offend her:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">But&mdash;meet no angels, Pansie?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The suggestion is obvious, that the maiden realizes to the
lover&rsquo;s eye the ideal of an angel. As she comes he asks her
slyly,&mdash;for she has been to the church&mdash;&ldquo;Is it true
that nobody ever sees real angels?&rdquo; She answers innocently,
thinking him to be in earnest, &ldquo;No&mdash;long ago people used
to see angels, but in these times no one ever sees them.&rdquo; He
does not dare tell her how beautiful she seems to him; but he
suggests much more than admiration by the tone of his protesting
response to her answer: &ldquo;What! You cannot mean to say that
there are no angels now?&rdquo; Of course that is the same as to
say, &ldquo;I see an angel now&rdquo;&mdash;but the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60">[60]</a></span>girl is much
too innocent to take the real and flattering meaning.</p>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s portrait of the ideal woman is very famous;
it was written about his own wife though that fact would not be
guessed from the poem. The last stanza is the most famous, but we
had better quote them all.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She was a phantom of delight</p>
<p>When first she gleamed upon my sight;</p>
<p>A lovely apparition, sent</p>
<p>To be a moment&rsquo;s ornament;</p>
<p>Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;</p>
<p>Like twilight&rsquo;s, too, her dusky hair;</p>
<p>But all things else about her drawn</p>
<p>From May-time and the cheerful dawn;</p>
<p>A dancing shape, an image gay,</p>
<p>To haunt, to startle, and waylay.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I saw her upon nearer view,</p>
<p>A Spirit, yet a Woman too!</p>
<p>Her household motions light and free,</p>
<p>And steps of virgin liberty;</p>
<p>A countenance in which did meet</p>
<p>Sweet records, promises as sweet;</p>
<p>A creature not too bright or good</p>
<p>For human nature&rsquo;s daily food;</p>
<p>For transient sorrows, simple wiles,</p>
<p>Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And now I see with eye serene</p>
<p>The very pulse of the machine;</p>
<p>A being breathing thoughtful breath,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61">[61]</a></span>
<p>A traveller betwixt life and death;</p>
<p>The reason firm, the temperate will,</p>
<p>Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;</p>
<p>A perfect woman, nobly plann&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>To warn, to comfort and command;</p>
<p>And yet a Spirit still, and bright</p>
<p>With something of angelic light.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I quoted this after the Pansie poem to show you how much more
deeply Wordsworth could touch the same subject. To him, too, the
first apparition of the ideal maiden seemed angelic; like Ashe he
could perceive the mingled attraction of innocence and of youth.
But innocence and youth are by no means all that make up the best
attributes of woman; character is more than innocence and more than
youth, and it is character that Wordsworth studies. But in the last
verse he tells us that the angel is always there, nevertheless,
even when the good woman becomes old. The angel is the
Mother-soul.</p>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s idea that character is the supreme charm was
expressed very long before him by other English poets, notably by

<p>He that loves a rosy cheek,</p>
<p class="i2">Or a coral lip admires,</p>
<p>Or from star-like eyes doth seek</p>
<p class="i2">Fuel to maintain his fires:</p>
<p>As old Time makes these decay,</p>
<p class="i2">So his flames must waste away.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But a smooth and steadfast mind,</p>

</div>
<p>For about three hundred years in English literature it was the
fashion&mdash;a fashion borrowed from the Latin poets&mdash;to
speak of love as a fire or flame, and you must understand the image
in these verses in that signification. To-day the fashion is not
quite dead, but very few poets now follow it.</p>
<p>Byron himself, with all his passion and his affected scorn of
ethical convention, could and did, when he pleased, draw beautiful
portraits of moral as well as physical attraction. These stanzas
are famous; they paint for us a person with equal attraction of
body and mind.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She walks in beauty, like the night</p>
<p class="i2">Of cloudless climes and starry skies;</p>
<p>And all that&rsquo;s best of dark and bright</p>

<p>Thus mellow&rsquo;d to that tender light</p>
<p class="i2">Which heaven to gaudy day denies.</p>

<p>One shade the more, one ray the less,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63">[63]</a></span>
<p>Where thoughts serenely sweet express</p>
<p class="i2">How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And on that cheek, and o&rsquo;er that brow,</p>
<p class="i2">So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,</p>
<p>The smiles that win, the tints that glow,</p>
<p class="i2">But tell of days in goodness spent,</p>
<p>A mind at peace with all below,</p>
<p class="i2">A heart whose love is innocent!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is worth noticing that in each of the last three poems, the
physical beauty described is that of dark eyes and hair. This may
serve to remind you that there are two distinct types, opposite
types, of beauty celebrated by English poets; and the next poem
which I am going to quote, the beautiful &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo; of
Thomas Hood, also describes a dark woman.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She stood breast-high amid the corn,</p>
<p>Clasp&rsquo;d by the golden light of morn,</p>
<p>Like the sweetheart of the sun,</p>
<p>Who many a glowing kiss had won.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>On her cheek an autumn flush,</p>
<p>Deeply ripen&rsquo;d;&mdash;such a blush</p>
<p>In the midst of brown was born,</p>
<p>Like red poppies grown with corn.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Round her eyes her tresses fell,</p>
<p>Which were blackest none could tell,</p>
<p>But long lashes veil&rsquo;d a light,</p>
<p>That had else been all too bright.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name=
"page64">[64]</a></span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And her hat, with shady brim,</p>
<p>Made her tressy forehead dim;</p>
<p>Thus she stood among the stooks,</p>
<p>Praising God with sweetest looks:&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sure, I said, Heav&rsquo;n did not mean,</p>
<p>Where I reap thou shouldst but glean,</p>
<p>Lay thy sheaf adown and come,</p>
<p>Share my harvest and my home.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We might call this the ideal of a peasant girl whose poverty
appeals to the sympathy of all who behold her. The name of the poem
is suggested indeed by the Bible story of Ruth the gleaner, but the
story in the poem is only that of a rich farmer who marries a very
poor girl, because of her beauty and her goodness. It is just a
charming picture&mdash;a picture of the dark beauty which is so
much admired in Northern countries, where it is less common than in
Southern Europe. There are beautiful brown-skinned types; and the
flush of youth on the cheeks of such a brown girl has been compared
to the red upon a ripe peach or a russet apple&mdash;a hard kind of
apple, very sweet and juicy, which is brown instead of yellow, or
reddish brown. But the poet makes the comparison with poppy flowers
and wheat. That, of course, means golden yellow and red; in English
wheat fields red poppy flowers grow in abundance. The expression
&ldquo;tressy forehead&rdquo; in the second line of the fourth
stanza means a forehead half covered with falling, loose hair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name=
"page65">[65]</a></span>The foregoing pretty picture may be offset
by charming poem of Browning&rsquo;s describing a lover&rsquo;s
pride in his illusion. It is simply entitled &ldquo;Song,&rdquo;
and to appreciate it you must try to understand the mood of a young
man who believes that he has actually realized his ideal, and that
the woman that he loves is the most beautiful person in the whole
world. The fact that this is simply imagination on his part does
not make the poem less beautiful&mdash;on the contrary, the false
imagining is just what makes it beautiful, the youthful emotion of
a moment being so humanly and frankly described. Such a youth must
imagine that every one else sees and thinks about the girl just as
he does, and he expects them to confess it.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Nay but you, who do not love her,</p>
<p class="i2">Is she not pure gold, my mistress?</p>
<p>Holds earth aught&mdash;speak truth&mdash;above her?</p>
<p class="i2">Aught like this tress, see, and this tress,</p>
<p>And this last fairest tress of all,</p>
<p>So fair, see, ere I let it fall?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Because you spend your lives in praising;</p>
<p class="i2">To praise, you search the wide world over;</p>
<p>Then why not witness, calmly gazing,</p>
<p class="i2">If earth holds aught&mdash;speak truth&mdash;above
her?</p>
<p>Above this tress, and this, I touch</p>
<p>But cannot praise, I love so much!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You see the picture, I think,&mdash;probably some <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page66" name=
"page66">[66]</a></span>artist&rsquo;s studio for a background. She
sits or stands there with her long hair loosely flowing down to her
feet like a river of gold; and her lover, lifting up some of the
long tresses in his hand, asks his friend, who stands by, to notice
how beautiful such hair is. Perhaps the girl was having her picture
painted. One would think so from the question, &ldquo;Since your
business is to look for beautiful things, why can you not honestly
acknowledge that this woman is the most beautiful thing in the
whole world?&rdquo; Or we might imagine the questioned person to be
a critic by profession as well as an artist. Like the preceding
poem this also is a picture. But the next poem, also by Browning,
is much more than a picture&mdash;it is very profound indeed,
simple as it looks. An old man is sitting by the dead body of a
young girl of about sixteen. He tells us how he secretly loved her,
as a father might love a daughter, as a brother might love a
sister. But he would have wished, if he had not been so old, and
she so young, to love her as a husband. He never could have her in
this world, but why should he not hope for it in the future world?
He whispers into her dead ear his wish, and he puts a flower into
her dead hand, thinking, &ldquo;When she wakes up, in another life,
she will see that flower, and remember what I said to her, and how
much I loved her.&rdquo; That is the mere story. But we must
understand that the greatness of the love <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67">[67]</a></span>expressed in
the poem is awakened by an ideal of innocence and sweetness and
goodness, and the affection is of the soul&mdash;that is to say, it
is the love of beautiful character, not the love of a beautiful
face only, that is expressed.</p>

</div>
<p>No other poet has written so many different kinds of poems on
this subject as Browning; and although I can not quote all of them,
I must not neglect to make a just representation of the variety.
Here is another example: the chief idea is again the beauty of
truthfulness and fidelity, but the artistic impression is quite
different.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A simple ring with a single stone,</p>
<p class="i2">To the vulgar eye no stone of price:</p>
<p>Whisper the right word, that alone&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Forth starts a sprite, like fire from ice.</p>
<p>And lo, you are lord (says an Eastern scroll)</p>
<p>Of heaven and earth, lord whole and sole</p>
<p class="i4">Through the power in a pearl.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A woman (&rsquo;tis I this time that say)</p>
<p class="i2">With little the world counts worthy praise:</p>
<p>Utter the true word&mdash;out and away</p>
<p class="i2">Escapes her soul; I am wrapt in blaze,</p>
<p>Creation&rsquo;s lord, of heaven and earth</p>
<p>Lord whole and sole&mdash;by a minute&rsquo;s birth&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Through the love in a girl!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Paraphrased, the meaning will not prove as simple as the verses:
Here is a finger ring set with one small stone, one jewel. It is a
very cheap-looking stone to common eyes. But if you know a certain
magical word, and, after putting the ring on your finger, you
whisper that magical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name=
"page70">[70]</a></span>word over the cheap-looking stone, suddenly
a spirit, a demon or a genie, springs from that gem like a flash of
fire miraculously issuing from a lump of ice. And that spirit or
genie has power to make you king of the whole world and of the sky
above the world, lord of the spirits of heaven and earth and air
and fire. Yet the stone is only&mdash;a pearl&mdash;and it can make
you lord of the universe. That is the old Arabian story. The word
scroll here means a manuscript, an Arabian manuscript.</p>
<p>But what is after all the happiness of mere power? There is a
greater happiness possible than to be lord of heaven and earth;
that is the happiness of being truly loved. Here is a woman; to the
eye of the world, to the sight of other men, she is not very
beautiful nor at all remarkable in any way. She is just an ordinary
woman, as the pearl in the ring is to all appearances just a common
pearl. But let the right word be said, let the soul of that woman
be once really touched by the magic of love, and what a revelation!
As the spirit in the Arabian story sprang from the stone of the
magical ring, when the word was spoken, so from the heart of this
woman suddenly her soul displays itself in shining light. And the
man who loves, instantly becomes, in the splendour of that light,
verily the lord of heaven and earth; to the eyes of the being who
loves him he is a god.</p>
<p>The legend is the legend of Solomon&mdash;not the Solomon of the
Bible, but the much more wonderful <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page71" name="page71">[71]</a></span>Solomon of the Arabian
story-teller. His power is said to have been in a certain seal
ring, upon which the mystical name of Allah, or at least one of the
ninety and nine mystical names, was engraved. When he chose to use
this ring, all the spirits of air, the spirits of earth, the
spirits of water and the spirits of fire were obliged to obey him.
The name of such a ring is usually &ldquo;Talisman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is another of Browning&rsquo;s jewels, one of the last
poems written shortly before his death. It is entitled
&ldquo;Summum Bonum,&rdquo;&mdash;signifying &ldquo;the highest
good.&rdquo; The subject is a kiss; we may understand that the
first betrothal kiss is the mark of affection described. When the
promise of marriage has been made, that promise is sealed or
confirmed by the first kiss. But this refers only to the refined
classes of society. Among the English people proper, especially the
country folk, kissing the girls is only a form of showing mere good
will, and has no serious meaning at all.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>All the breath and the bloom of the year in the bag of one
bee:</p>
<p class="i2">All the wonder and wealth of the mine in the heart of
one gem:</p>
<p>In the core of one pearl all the shade and the shine of the
sea:</p>
<p class="i2">Breath and bloom, shade and shine,&mdash;wonder,
wealth, and&mdash;how far above them&mdash;</p>
<p>Truth, that&rsquo;s brighter than gem,</p>
<p class="i2">Trust, that&rsquo;s purer than pearl,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72">[72]</a></span>
<p>Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe&mdash;all were for
me</p>
<p class="i2">In the kiss of one girl.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is in this a suggestion of Ben Jonson, who uses almost
exactly the same simile without any moral significance. The
advantage of Browning is that he has used the sensuous imagery for
ethical symbolism; here he greatly surpasses Jonson, though it
would be hard to improve upon the beauty of Jonson&rsquo;s verses,
as merely describing visual beauty. Here are Jonson&rsquo;s
stanzas:</p>
<h4>The Triumph</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>See the Chariot at hand here of Love,</p>
<p class="i2">Wherein my Lady rideth!</p>
<p>Each that draws is a swan or a dove,</p>
<p class="i2">And well the car Love guideth.</p>
<p>As she goes, all hearts do duty</p>
<p class="i2">Unto her beauty;</p>
<p>And enamoured do wish, so they might</p>
<p class="i2">But enjoy such a sight,</p>
<p>That they still were to run by her side,</p>
<p>Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Do but look on her eyes, they do light</p>
<p class="i2">All that Love&rsquo;s world compriseth!</p>
<p>Do but look on her hair, it is bright</p>
<p class="i2">As love&rsquo;s star when it riseth!</p>
<p>Do but mark, her forehead&rsquo;s smoother</p>
<p class="i2">Than words that soothe her;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73">[73]</a></span>
<p>And from her arch&rsquo;d brows such a grace</p>
<p class="i2">Sheds itself through the face,</p>
<p>As alone there triumphs to the life</p>
<p>All the gain, all the good, of the elements&rsquo; strife.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Have you seen but a bright lily grow</p>
<p class="i2">Before rude hands have touched it?</p>
<p>Have you mark&rsquo;d but the fall of the snow</p>
<p class="i2">Before the soil hath smutch&rsquo;d it?</p>
<p>Have you felt the wool of beaver</p>
<p class="i2">Or swan&rsquo;s down ever?</p>
<p>Or have smelt o&rsquo; the bud o&rsquo; the brier,</p>
<p class="i2">Or the nard in the fire?</p>
<p>Or have tasted the bag of the bee?</p>
<p>O so white, O so soft, O so sweet is she!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first of the above stanzas is a study after the Roman poets;
but the last stanza is Jonson&rsquo;s own and is very famous. You
will see that Browning was probably inspired by him, but I think
that his verses are much more beautiful in thought and feeling.</p>
<p>There is one type of ideal woman very seldom described in
poetry&mdash;the old maid, the woman whom sorrow or misfortune
prevents from fulfilling her natural destiny. Commonly the woman
who never marries is said to become cross, bad tempered, unpleasant
in character. She could not be blamed for this, I think; but there
are old maids who always remain as unselfish and frank and kind as
a girl, and who keep the charm of girlhood even when their hair is
white. Hartley <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name=
"page74">[74]</a></span>Coleridge, son of the great Samuel,
attempted to describe such a one, and his picture is both touching
and beautiful.</p>
<h4>The Solitary-Hearted</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She was a queen of noble Nature&rsquo;s crowning,</p>
<p class="i2">A smile of hers was like an act of grace;</p>
<p>She had no winsome looks, no pretty frowning,</p>
<p class="i2">Like daily beauties of the vulgar race:</p>
<p>But if she smiled, a light was on her face,</p>
<p class="i2">A clear, cool kindliness, a lunar beam</p>
<p>Of peaceful radiance, silvering o&rsquo;er the stream</p>
<p class="i2">Of human thought with unabiding glory;</p>
<p>Not quite a waking truth, not quite a dream,</p>
<p class="i2">A visitation, bright and transitory.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But she is changed,&mdash;hath felt the touch of sorrow,</p>
<p class="i2">No love hath she, no understanding friend;</p>
<p>O grief! when Heaven is forced of earth to borrow</p>
<p class="i2">What the poor niggard earth has not to lend;</p>
<p>But when the stalk is snapt, the rose must bend.</p>
<p class="i2">The tallest flower that skyward rears its head</p>
<p>Grows from the common ground, and there must shed</p>
<p class="i2">Its delicate petals. Cruel fate, too surely</p>
<p>That they should find so base a bridal bed,</p>
<p class="i2">Who lived in virgin pride, so sweet and purely.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She had a brother, and a tender father,</p>
<p class="i2">And she was loved, but not as others are</p>
<p>From whom we ask return of love,&mdash;but rather</p>
<p class="i2">As one might love a dream; a phantom fair</p>
<p>Of something exquisitely strange and rare,</p>
<p class="i2">Which all were glad to look on, men and maids,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75">[75]</a></span>
<p>Yet no one claimed&mdash;as oft, in dewy glades,</p>
<p class="i2">The peering primrose, like a sudden gladness,</p>
<p>Gleams on the soul, yet unregarded fades;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The joy is ours, but all its own the sadness.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&rsquo;Tis vain to say&mdash;her worst of grief is only</p>
<p class="i2">The common lot, which all the world have known</p>
<p>To her &lsquo;tis more, because her heart is lonely,</p>
<p class="i2">And yet she hath no strength to stand
alone,&mdash;</p>
<p>Once she had playmates, fancies of her own,</p>
<p class="i2">And she did love them. They are past away</p>
<p>As fairies vanish at the break of day;</p>
<p class="i2">And like a spectre of an age departed,</p>
<p>Or unsphered angel woefully astray,</p>
<p class="i2">She glides along&mdash;the solitary-hearted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps it is scarcely possible for you to imagine that a woman
finds it impossible to marry because of being too beautiful, too
wise, and too good. In Western countries it is not impossible at
all. You must try to imagine entirely different social
conditions&mdash;conditions in which marriage depends much more
upon the person than upon the parents, much more upon inclination
than upon anything else. A woman&rsquo;s chances of marriage depend
very much upon herself, upon her power of pleasing and charming.
Thousands and tens of thousands can never get married. Now there
are cases in which a woman can please too much. Men become afraid
of her. They think, &ldquo;She knows too much, I dare not be frank
with her&rdquo;&mdash;or, &ldquo;She is too beautiful, she never
would accept <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name=
"page76">[76]</a></span>a common person like me&rdquo;&mdash;or,
&ldquo;She is too formal and correct, she would never forgive a
mistake, and I could never be happy with her.&rdquo; Not only is
this possible, but it frequently happens. Too much excellence makes
a misfortune. I think you can understand it best by the reference
to the very natural prejudice against over-educated women, a
prejudice founded upon experience and existing in all countries,
even in Japan. Men are not attracted to a woman because she is
excellent at mathematics, because she knows eight or nine different
languages, because she has acquired all the conventions of
high-pressure training. Men do not care about that. They want love
and trust and kindliness and ability to make a home beautiful and
happy. Well, the poem we have been reading is very pathetic because
it describes a woman who can not fulfil her natural destiny, can
not be loved&mdash;this through no fault of her own, but quite the
reverse. To be too much advanced beyond one&rsquo;s time and
environment is even a worse misfortune than to be too much
behind.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_4" name="Ch_4">Chapter IV</a></h3>
<h2>Note Upon the Shortest Forms of English Poetry</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Perhaps there is an idea among Japanese students that one
general difference between Japanese and Western poetry is that the
former cultivates short forms and the latter longer ones, gut this
is only in part true. It is true that short forms of poetry have
been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe; but in
all European literature short forms of poetry are to be
found&mdash;indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese. Like the
Japanese, the old Greeks, who carried poetry to the highest
perfection that it has ever attained, delighted in short forms; and
the Greek Anthology is full of compositions containing only two or
three lines. You will find beautiful translations of these in
Symonds&rsquo;s &ldquo;Studies of Greek Poets,&rdquo; in the second
volume. Following Greek taste, the Roman poets afterwards
cultivated short forms of verse, but they chiefly used such verse
for satirical purposes, unfortunately; I say, unfortunately,
because the first great English poets who imitated the ancients
were chiefly influenced by the Latin writers, and they <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78">[78]</a></span>also used the
short forms for epigrammatic satire rarely for a purely esthetic
object. Ben Jonson both wrote and translated a great number of very
short stanzas&mdash;two lines and four lines; but Jonson was a
satirist in these forms. Herrick, as you know, delighted in very
short poems; but he was greatly influenced by Jonson, and many of
his couplets and of his quatrains are worthless satires or
worthless jests. However, you will find some short verses in
Herrick that almost make you think of a certain class of Japanese
poems. After the Elizabethan Age, also, the miniature poems were
still used in the fashion set by the Roman writers,&mdash;then the
eighteenth century deluged us with ill-natured witty epigrams of
the like brief form. It was not until comparatively modern times
that our Western world fully recognized the value of the distich,
triplet or quatrain for the expression of beautiful thoughts,
rather than for the expression of ill-natured ones. But now that
the recognition has come, it has been discovered that nothing is
harder than to write a beautiful poem of two or four lines. Only
great masters have been truly successful at it. Goethe, you know,
made a quatrain that has become a part of world-literature:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Who ne&rsquo;er his bread in sorrow ate,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Who ne&rsquo;er the lonely midnight hours,</p>
<p>Weeping upon his bed has sate,</p>
<p class="i2">He knows ye not, ye Heavenly Powers!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name=
"page79">[79]</a></span>&mdash;meaning, of course, that inspiration
and wisdom come to us only through sorrow, and that those who have
never suffered never can be wise. But in the universities of
England a great deal of short work of a most excellent kind has
been done in Greek and Latin; and there is the celebrated case of
an English student who won a prize by a poem of a single line. The
subject given had been the miracle of Christ&rsquo;s turning water
into wine at the marriage feast; and while other scholars attempted
elaborate composition on the theme, this student wrote but one
verse, of which the English translation is</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The modest water saw its Lord, and blushed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of course the force of the idea depends upon the popular
conception of wine being red. The Latin and Greek model, however,
did not seem to encourage much esthetic effort in short poems of
English verse until the time of the romantic movement. Then, both
in France and England, many brief forms of poetry made their
appearance. In France, Victor Hugo attempted composition in
astonishingly varied forms of verse&mdash;some forms actually
consisting of only two syllables to a line. With this surprisingly
short measure begins one of Hugo&rsquo;s most remarkably early
poems, &ldquo;Les Djins,&rdquo; representing the coming of evil
spirits with a storm, their passing over the house where a man is
at prayer, and departing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name=
"page80">[80]</a></span>into the distance again. Beginning with
only two syllables to the line, the measure of the poem gradually
widens as the spirits approach, becomes very wide, very long and
sonorous as they reach the house, and again shrinks back to lines
of two syllables as the sound of them dies away. In England a like
variety of experiments has been made; but neither in France nor in
England has the short form yet been as successfully cultivated as
it was among the Greeks. We have some fine examples; but, as an
eminent English editor observed a few years ago, not enough
examples to make a book. And of course this means that there are
very few; for you can make a book of poetry very well with as
little as fifty pages of largely and widely printed text. However,
we may cite a few modern instances.</p>
<p>I think that about the most perfect quatrains we have are those
of the extraordinary man, Walter Savage Landor, who, you know, was
a rare Greek scholar, all his splendid English work being very
closely based upon the Greek models. He made a little epitaph upon
himself, which is matchless of its kind:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I strove with none, for none was worth my strife;</p>
<p class="i2">Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;</p>
<p>I warmed both hands before the fire of life:</p>
<p class="i2">It sinks; and I am ready to depart.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You know that Greeks used the short form a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81">[81]</a></span>great deal
for their exquisite epitaphs, and that a considerable part of the
anthology consists of epitaphic literature. But the quatrain has a
much wider range than this funereal limitation, and one such
example of epitaph will suffice.</p>
<p>Only one English poet of our own day, and that a minor one, has
attempted to make the poem of four lines a specialty&mdash;that is
William Watson. He has written a whole volume of such little poems,
but very few of them are successful. As I said before, we have not
enough good poems of this sort for a book; and the reason is not
because English poets despise the short form, but because it is
supremely difficult. The Greeks succeeded in it, but we are still
far behind the Greeks in the shaping of any kind of verse. The best
of Watson&rsquo;s pieces take the form of philosophical
suggestions; and this kind of verse is particularly well adapted to
philosophical utterance.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Think not thy wisdom can illume away</p>
<p>The ancient tanglement of night and day.</p>
<p>Enough to acknowledge both, and both revere;</p>
<p>They see not clearliest who see all things clear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is to say, do not think that any human knowledge will ever
be able to make you understand the mystery of the universe with its
darkness and light, its joy and pain. It is best to revere the
powers that make both good and evil, and to remember that the
keenest, worldly, practical minds <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page82" name="page82">[82]</a></span>are not the minds that best
perceive the great truths and mysteries of existence. Here is
another little bit, reminding us somewhat of Goethe&rsquo;s
quatrain, already quoted.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Lives there whom pain hath evermore passed by</p>
<p>And sorrow shunned with an averted eye?</p>
<p>Him do thou pity,&mdash;him above the rest,</p>
<p>Him, of all hapless mortals most unblessed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That needs no commentary, and it contains a large truth in small
space. Here is a little bit on the subject of the artist&rsquo;s
ambition, which is also good.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The thousand painful steps at last are trod,</p>
<p class="i2">At last the temple&rsquo;s difficult door we win,</p>
<p>But perfect on his pedestal, the God</p>
<p class="i2">Freezes us hopeless when we enter in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The higher that the artist climbs by effort, the nearer his
approach to the loftier truth, the more he understands how little
his very best can achieve. It is the greatest artist, he who
veritably enters the presence of God&mdash;that most feels his own
weakness; the perception of beauty that other men can not see,
terrifies him, freezes him motionless, as the poet says.</p>
<p>Out of all of Watson&rsquo;s epigrams I believe these are the
best. The rest with the possible exception of those on the subject
of love seem to me altogether failures. Emerson and various
American <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name=
"page83">[83]</a></span>poets also attempted the quatrain&mdash;but
Emerson&rsquo;s verse is nearly always bad, even when his thought
is sublime. One example of Emerson will suffice.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thou canst not wave thy staff in air,</p>
<p class="i2">Or dip thy paddle in the lake,</p>
<p>But it carves the bow of beauty there,</p>
<p class="i2">And the ripples in rhyme the oar forsake.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The form is atrociously bad; but the reflection is
grand&mdash;it is another way of expressing the beautiful old Greek
thought that &ldquo;God <em>geometrizes</em>
everywhere&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that all motion is in geometrical
lines, and full of beauty. You can pick hundreds of fine things in
very short verse out of Emerson, but the verse is nearly always
shapeless; the composition of the man invariably makes us think of
diamonds in the rough, jewels uncut. So far as form goes a much
better master of quatrain is the American poet Aldrich, who wrote
the following little thing, entitled &ldquo;Popularity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Such kings of shreds have wooed and won her,</p>
<p class="i2">Such crafty knaves her laurel owned,</p>
<p>It has become almost an honour</p>
<p class="i2">Not to be crowned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is good verse. The reference to &ldquo;a king of shreds and
patches&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a beggar king&mdash;you will
recognize as Shakespearean. But although this pretty verse has in
it more philosophy than satire, it approaches the satiric class of
epigrams. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name=
"page84">[84]</a></span>Neither America nor England has been able
to do very much in the sort of verse that we have been talking
about. Now this is a very remarkable thing,&mdash;because at the
English universities beautiful work has been done in Greek or
Latin&mdash;in poems of a single line, of two lines, of three lines
and other very brief measures. Why can it not be done in English? I
suspect that it is because our English language has not yet become
sufficiently perfect, sufficiently flexible, sufficiently melodious
to allow of great effect with a very few words. We can do the thing
in Greek or in Latin because either Greek or Latin is a more
perfect language.</p>
<p>So much for theory. I should like to suggest, however, that it
is very probable many attempts at these difficult forms of poetry
will be attempted by English poets within the next few years. There
is now a tendency in that direction. I do not know whether such
attempts will be successful; but I should like you to understand
that for Western poets they are extremely difficult and that you
ought to obtain from the recognition of this fact a new sense of
the real value of your own short forms of verse in the hands of a
master. Effects can be produced in Japanese which the Greeks could
produce with few syllables, but which the English can not. Now it
strikes me that, instead of even thinking of throwing away old
forms of verse in order to invent new ones, the future Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name=
"page85">[85]</a></span>poets ought rather to develop and cultivate
and prize the forms already existing, which belong to the genius of
the language, and which have proved themselves capable of much that
no English verse or even French verse could accomplish. Perhaps
only the Italian is really comparable to Japanese in some respects;
you can perform miracles with Italian verse.</p>

<h2>Some Foreign Poems on Japanese Subjects</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The Western poet and writer of romance has exactly the same kind
of difficulty in comprehending Eastern subjects as you have in
comprehending Western subjects. You will commonly find references
to Japanese love poems of the popular kind made in such a way as to
indicate the writer&rsquo;s belief that such poems refer to married
life or at least to a courtship relation. No Western writer who has
not lived for many years in the East, could write correctly about
anything on this subject; and even after a long stay in the country
he might be unable to understand. Therefore a great deal of Western
poetry written about Japan must seem to you all wrong, and I can
not hope to offer you many specimens of work in this direction that
could deserve your praise. Yet there is some poetry so fine on the
subject of Japan that I think you would admire it and I am sure
that you should know it. A proof of really great art is that it is
generally true&mdash;it seldom falls into the misapprehensions to
which minor art is liable. What do you think of the fact that the
finest poetry ever written upon a Japanese subject by any Western
poet, has been written by a man who never saw <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87">[87]</a></span>the land? But
he is a member of the French Academy, a great and true lover of
art, and without a living superior in that most difficult form of
poetry, the sonnet. In the time of thirty years he produced only
one very small volume of sonnets, but so fine are these that they
were lifted to the very highest place in poetical distinction. I
may say that there are now only three really great French
poets&mdash;survivals of the grand romantic school. These are
Leconte de Lisle, Sully-Prudhomme, and Jos&eacute; Maria de
Heredia. It is the last of whom I am speaking. As you can tell by
his name, he is not a Frenchman either by birth or blood, but a
Spaniard, or rather a Spanish Creole, born in Cuba. Heredia knows
Japan only through pictures, armour, objects of art in museums,
paintings and carvings. Remembering this, I think that you will
find that he does wonderfully well. It is true that he puts a woman
in one of his pictures, but I think that his management of his
subject is very much nearer the truth than that of almost any
writer who has attempted to describe old Japan. And you must
understand that the following sonnet is essentially intended to be
a picture&mdash;to produce upon the mind exactly the same effect
that a picture does, with the addition of such life as poetry can
give.</p>
<h3>Le Samourai</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>D&rsquo;un doigt distrait fr&ocirc;lant la sonore
b&icirc;va,</p>
<p>A travers les bambous tress&eacute;s en fine latte,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88">[88]</a></span>
<p>Elle a vu, par la plage &eacute;blouissante et plate,</p>
<p>S&rsquo;avancer le vainqueur que son amour r&ecirc;va.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>C&rsquo;est lui. Sabres au flanc, l&rsquo;&eacute;ventail haut,
il va.</p>
<p>La cordeli&egrave;re rouge et le gland &eacute;carlate</p>
<p>Coupent l&rsquo;armure sombre, et, sur l&rsquo;&eacute;paule,
&eacute;clate</p>
<p>Le blazon de Hizen ou de Tokungawa.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ce beau guerrier v&ecirc;tu de lames et de plaques,</p>
<p>Sous le bronze, la soie et les brillantes laques,</p>
<p>Semble un crustace noir, gigantesque et vermeil.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Il l&rsquo;a vue. Il sourit dans la barbe du masque,</p>
<p>Et son pas plus h&acirc;tif fait reluire au soleil</p>
<p>Les deux antennes d&rsquo;or qui tremblent &agrave; son
casque.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lightly touching her <em>biva</em> with heedless finger,
she has perceived, through the finely woven bamboo screen, the
conqueror, lovingly thought of, approach over the dazzling level of
the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he. With his swords at his side he advances,
holding up his fan. The red girdle and the scarlet tassel appear in
sharply cut relief against the dark armour; and upon his shoulder
glitters a crest of Hizen or of Tokungawa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This handsome warrior sheathed with his scales and plates
of metal, under his bronze, his silk and glimmering lacquer, seems
a crustacean, gigantic, black and vermilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has caught sight of her. Under the beaver of the war
mask he smiles, and his quickened step <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page89" name="page89">[89]</a></span>makes to glitter in the sun
the two antenn&aelig; of gold that quiver upon his
helmet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comparison of a warrior in full armour to a gigantic crab or
lobster, especially lobster, is not exactly new. Victor Hugo has
used it before in French literature, just as Carlyle has used it in
English literature; indeed the image could not fail to occur to the
artist in any country where the study of armour has been carried
on. But here the poet does not speak of any particular creature; he
uses only the generic term, crustacean, the vagueness of which
makes the comparison much more effective. I think you can see the
whole picture at once. It is a Japanese colour-print,&mdash;some
ancient interior, lighted by the sun of a great summer day; and a
woman looking through a bamboo blind toward the seashore, where she
sees a warrior approaching. He divines that he is seen; but if he
smiles, it is only because the smile is hidden by his iron mask.
The only sign of any sentiment on his part is that he walks a
little quicker. Still more amazing is a companion picture,
containing only a solitary figure:</p>
<h3>Le Daimio (Matin de bataille)</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sous le noir fouet de guerre &agrave; quadruple pompon,</p>
<p>L&rsquo;&eacute;talon belliqueux en hennissant se cabre,</p>

<p>Le Chef v&ecirc;tu d&rsquo;airain, de laque et de

<p>Regarde le volcan sur un ciel de cinabre</p>
<p>Dresser la neige o&ugrave; rit l&rsquo;aurore du Nippon.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Mais il a vu, vers l&rsquo;Est &eacute;clabouss&eacute;
d&rsquo;or, l&rsquo;astre,</p>
<p>Glorieux d&rsquo;&eacute;clairer ce matin de
d&eacute;sastre,</p>
<p>Poindre, orbe &eacute;blouissant, au-dessus de la mer;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Et pour couvrir ses yeux dont pas un cil ne bouge,</p>
<p>Il ouvre d&rsquo;un seul coup son &eacute;ventail de fer,</p>
<p>O&ugrave; dans le satin blanc se l&egrave;ve un Soleil
rouge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Under the black war whip with its quadruple pompon the
fierce stallion, whinnying, curvets, and makes the rider&rsquo;s
bronze cuirass ring against the plates of his shirt of mail, with a
sound like the clashing of sword blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief, clad in bronze and lacquer and silken crape,
removing the bearded masque from his beardless face, turns his gaze
to the great volcano, lifting its snows into the cinnabar sky where
the dawn of Nippon begins to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay! he has already seen the gold-spattered day star,
gloriously illuminating the morning of disaster, rise, a blinding
disk, above the seas. And to shade his eyes, on both of which not
even a single eyelash stirs, he opens with one quick movement his
iron fan, wherein upon a field of white satin there rises a crimson
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course this hasty translation is very poor; and you can only
get from it the signification and <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page91" name="page91">[91]</a></span>colour of the
picture&mdash;the beautiful sonority and luminosity of the French
is all gone. Nevertheless, I am sure that the more you study the
original the more you will see how fine it is. Here also is a
Japanese colour print. We see the figure of the horseman on the
shore, in the light of dawn; behind him the still dark sky of
night; before him the crimson dawn, and Fuji white against the red
sky. And in the open fan, with its red sun, we have a grim
suggestion of the day of blood that is about to be; that is all.
But whoever reads that sonnet will never forget it; it burns into
the memory. So, indeed, does everything that Heredia writes.
Unfortunately he has not yet written anything more about Japan.</p>
<p>I have quoted Heredia because I think that no other poet has
even approached him in the attempt to make a Japanese
picture&mdash;though many others have tried; and the French, nearly
always, have done much better than the English, because they are
more naturally artists. Indeed one must be something of an artist
to write anything in the way of good poetry on a Japanese subject.
If you look at the collection &ldquo;Poems of Places,&rdquo; in the
library, you will see how poorly Japan is there represented; the
only respectable piece of foreign work being by Longfellow, and
that is only about Japanese vases. But since then some English
poems have appeared which are at least worthy of Japanese
notice.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_6" name="Ch_6">Chapter VI</a></h3>
<h2>The Bible in English Literature</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the English Bible is, next to
Shakespeare, the greatest work in English literature, and that it
will have much more influence than even Shakespeare upon the
written and spoken language of the English race. For this reason,
to study English literature without some general knowledge of the
relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave
one&rsquo;s literary education very incomplete. It is not necessary
to consider the work from a religious point of view at all; indeed,
to so consider it would be rather a hindrance to the understanding
of its literary excellence. Some persons have ventured to say that
it is only since Englishmen ceased to believe in the Bible that
they began to discover how beautiful it was. This is not altogether
true; but it is partly true. For it is one thing to consider every
word of a book as the word of God or gods, and another thing to
consider it simply as the work of men like ourselves. Naturally we
should think it our duty to suppose the work of a divine being
perfect in itself, and to imagine beauty and truth where neither
really exists. The wonder of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93"
name="page93">[93]</a></span>the English Bible can really be best
appreciated by those who, knowing it to be the work of men much
less educated and cultivated than the scholars of the nineteenth
century, nevertheless perceive that those men were able to do in
literature what no man of our own day could possibly do.</p>
<p>Of course in considering the work of the translators, we must
remember the magnificence of the original. I should not like to say
that the Bible is the greatest of all religious books. From the
moral point of view it contains very much that we can not to-day
approve of; and what is good in it can be found in the sacred books
of other nations. Its ethics can not even claim to be absolutely
original. The ancient Egyptian scriptures contain beauties almost
superior in moral exaltation to anything contained in the Old
Testament; and the sacred books of other Eastern nations, notably
the sacred books of India, surpass the Hebrew scriptures in the
highest qualities of imagination and of profound thought. It is
only of late years that Europe, through the labour of Sanskrit and
Pali scholars, has become acquainted with the astonishing beauty of
thought and feeling which Indian scholars enshrined in scriptures
much more voluminous than the Hebrew Bible; and it is not
impossible that this far-off literature will some day influence
European thought quite as much as the Jewish Bible. Everywhere
to-day in Europe and America the study of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94">[94]</a></span>Buddhist and
Sanskrit literature is being pursued not only with eagerness but
with enthusiasm&mdash;an enthusiasm which sometimes reaches to
curious extremes. I might mention, in example, the case of a rich
man who recently visited Japan on his way from India. He had in New
Zealand a valuable property; he was a man of high culture, and of
considerable social influence. One day he happened to read an
English translation of the &ldquo;Bhagavad-Gita.&rdquo; Almost
immediately he resolved to devote the rest of his life to religious
study in India, in a monastery among the mountains; and he gave up
wealth, friends, society, everything that Western civilization
could offer him, in order to seek truth in a strange country.
Certainly this is not the only instance of the kind; and while such
incidents can happen, we may feel sure that the influence of
religious literature is not likely to die for centuries to
come.</p>
<p>But every great scripture, whether Hebrew, Indian, Persian, or
Chinese, apart from its religious value will be found to have some
rare and special beauty of its own; and in this respect the
original Bible stands very high as a monument of sublime poetry and
of artistic prose. If it is not the greatest of religious books as
a literary creation, it is at all events one of the greatest; and
the proof is to be found in the inspiration which millions and
hundreds of millions, dead and living, have obtained from its
utterances. The Semitic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name=
"page95">[95]</a></span>races have always possessed in a very high
degree the genius of poetry, especially poetry in which imagination
plays a great part; and the Bible is the monument of Semitic genius
in this regard. Something in the serious, stern, and reverential
spirit of the genius referred to made a particular appeal to
Western races having certain characteristics of the same kind.
Themselves uncultivated in the time that the Bible was first made
known to them, they found in it almost everything that they thought
and felt, expressed in a much better way than they could have
expressed it. Accordingly the Northern races of Europe found their
inspiration in the Bible; and the enthusiasm for it has not yet
quite faded away.</p>
<p>But the value of the original, be it observed, did not make the
value of the English Bible. Certainly it was an inspiring force;
but it was nothing more. The English Bible is perhaps a much
greater piece of fine literature, altogether considered, than the
Hebrew Bible. It was so for a particular reason which it is very
necessary for the student to understand. The English Bible is a
product of literary evolution.</p>
<p>In studying English criticisms upon different authors, I think
that you must have sometimes felt impatient with the critics who
told you, for example, that Tennyson was partly inspired by
Wordsworth and partly by Keats and partly by Coleridge; and that
Coleridge was partly inspired <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"
name="page96">[96]</a></span>by Blake and Blake by the
Elizabethans, and so on. You may have been tempted to say, as I
used very often myself to say, &ldquo;What does it matter where the
man got his ideas from? I care only for the beauty that is in his
work, not for a history of his literary education.&rdquo; But
to-day the value of the study of such relations appears in quite a
new light. Evolutional philosophy, applied to the study of
literature as to everything else, has shown us conclusively that
man is not a god who can make something out of nothing, and that
every great work of genius must depend even less upon the man of
genius himself than upon the labours of those who lived before him.
Every great author must draw his thoughts and his knowledge in part
from other great authors, and these again from previous authors,
and so on back, till we come to that far time in which there was no
written literature, but only verses learned by heart and memorized
by all the people of some one tribe or place, and taught by them to
their children and to their grandchildren. It is only in Greek
mythology that the divinity of Wisdom leaps out of a god&rsquo;s
head, in full armour. In the world of reality the more beautiful a
work of art, the longer, we may be sure, was the time required to
make it, and the greater the number of different minds which
assisted in its development.</p>
<p>So with the English Bible. No one man could have made the
translation of 1611. No one generation <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page97" name="page97">[97]</a></span>of men could have done it. It
was not the labour of a single century. It represented the work of
hundreds of translators working through hundreds of years, each
succeeding generation improving a little upon the work of the
previous generation, until in the seventeenth century the best had
been done of which the English brain and the English language was
capable. In no other way can the surprising beauties of style and
expression be explained. No subsequent effort could improve the
Bible of King James. Every attempt made since the seventeenth
century has only resulted in spoiling and deforming the strength
and the beauty of the authorized text.</p>
<p>Now you will understand why, from the purely literary point of
view, the English Bible is of the utmost importance for study.
Suppose we glance for a moment at the principal events in the
history of this evolution.</p>
<p>The first translation of the Bible into a Western tongue was
that made by Jerome (commonly called Saint Jerome) in the fourth
century; he translated directly from the Hebrew and other Arabic
languages into Latin, then the language of the Empire. This
translation into Latin was called the Vulgate,&mdash;from
<em>vulgare</em>, &ldquo;to make generally known.&rdquo; The
Vulgate is still used in the Roman church. The first English
translations which have been preserved to us were made from the
Vulgate, not from the original tongues. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98">[98]</a></span> First of
all, John Wycliffe&rsquo;s Bible may be called the foundation of
the seventeenth century Bible. Wycliffe&rsquo;s translation, in
which he was helped by many others, was published between 1380 and
1388. So we may say that the foundation of the English Bible dates
from the fourteenth century, one thousand years after
Jerome&rsquo;s Latin translation. But Wycliffe&rsquo;s version,
excellent as it was, could not serve very long: the English
language was changing too quickly. Accordingly, in the time of
Henry VIII Tyndale and Coverdale, with many others, made a new
translation, this time not from the Vulgate, but from the Greek
text of the great scholar Erasmus. This was the most important
literary event of the time, for &ldquo;it coloured the entire
complexion of subsequent English prose,&rdquo;&mdash;to use the
words of Professor Gosse. This means that all prose in English
written since Henry VIII has been influenced, directly or
indirectly, by the prose of Tyndale&rsquo;s Bible, which was
completed about 1535. Almost at the same time a number of English
divines, under the superintendence of Archbishop Cramner, gave to
the English language a literary treasure scarcely inferior to the
Bible itself, and containing wonderful translations from the
Scriptures,&mdash;the &ldquo;Book of Common Prayer.&rdquo; No
English surpasses the English of this book, still used by the
Church; and many translators have since found new inspiration from
it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name=
"page99">[99]</a></span>A revision of this famous Bible was made in
1565, entitled &ldquo;The Bishops&rsquo; Bible.&rdquo; The cause of
the revision was largely doctrinal, and we need not trouble
ourselves about this translation farther than to remark that
Protestantism was reshaping the Scriptures to suit the new state
religion. Perhaps this edition may have had something to do with
the determination of the Roman Catholics to make an English Bible
of their own. The Jesuits began the work in 1582 at Rheims, and by
1610 the Roman Catholic version known as the Douay (or Douai)
version&mdash;because of its having been made chiefly at the
Catholic College of Douai in France&mdash;was completed. This
version has many merits; next to the wonderful King James version,
it is certainly the most poetical; and it has the further advantage
of including a number of books which Protestantism has thrown out
of the authorized version, but which have been used in the Roman
church since its foundation. But I am speaking of the book only as
a literary English production. It was not made with the help of
original sources; its merits are simply those of a melodious
translation from the Latin Vulgate.</p>
<p>At last, in 1611, was made, under the auspices of King James,
the famous King James version; and this is the great literary
monument of the English language. It was the work of many learned
men; but the chief worker and supervisor <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100">[100]</a></span>was the
Bishop of Winchester, Lancelot Andrews, perhaps the most eloquent
English preacher that ever lived. He was a natural-born orator,
with an exquisite ear for the cadences of language. To this natural
faculty of the Bishop&rsquo;s can be attributed much of the musical
charm of the English in which the Bible was written. Still, it must
not be supposed that he himself did all the work, or even more than
a small proportion of it. What he did was to tone it; he overlooked
and corrected all the text submitted to him, and suffered only the
best forms to survive. Yet what magnificent material he had to
choose from! All the translations of the Bible that had been made
before his time were carefully studied with a view to the
conservation of the best phrases, both for sound and for form. We
must consider the result not merely as a study of literature in
itself, but also as a study of eloquence; for every attention was
given to those effects to be expected from an oratorical recitation
of the text in public.</p>
<p>This marks the end of the literary evolution of the Bible.
Everything that has since been done has only been in the direction
of retrogression, of injury to the text. We have now a great many
later versions, much more scholarly, so far as correct scholarship
is concerned, than the King James version, but none having any
claim to literary importance. Unfortunately, exact scholars are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name=
"page101">[101]</a></span>very seldom men of literary ability; the
two faculties are rarely united. The Bible of 1870, known as the
Oxford Bible, and now used in the Anglican state-church, evoked a
great protest from the true men of letters, the poets and critics
who had found their inspirations in the useful study of the old
version. The new version was the work of fourteen years; it was
made by the united labour of the greatest scholars in the
English-speaking world; and it is far the most exact translation
that we have. Nevertheless the literary quality has been injured to
such an extent that no one will ever turn to the new revision for
poetical study. Even among the churches there was a decided
condemnation of this scholarly treatment of the old text; and many
of the churches refused to use the book. In this case, conservatism
is doing the literary world a service, keeping the old King James
version in circulation, and insisting especially upon its use in
Sunday schools.</p>
<p>We may now take a few examples of the differences between the
revised version and the Bible of King James. Professor Saintsbury,
in an essay upon English prose, published some years ago, said that
the most perfect piece of English prose in the language was that
comprised in the sixth and seventh verses of the eighth chapter of
the Song of Songs:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102">[pg
102]</a></span>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon
thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the
grave; the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
vehement flame.</p>
<p>Many waters can not quench love, neither can the floods drown
it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it
would utterly be condemned.</p>
</div>
<p>I should not like to say that the Professor is certainly right
in calling this the finest prose in the English language; but he is
a very great critic, whose opinion must be respected and
considered, and the passage is certainly very fine. But in the
revised version, how tame the same text has become in the hands of
the scholarly translators!</p>
<div class="quote">The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very
flame of the Lord.</div>
<p>Now as a description of jealousy, not to speak of the literary
execution at all, which is the best? What, we may ask, has been
gained by calling jealousy &ldquo;a flame of the Lord&rdquo; or by
substituting the word &ldquo;flashes&rdquo; for &ldquo;coals of
fire&rdquo;? All through the new version are things of this kind.
For example, in the same Song of Songs there is a beautiful
description of eyes, like &ldquo;doves by the rivers of waters,
washed with milk, and fitly set.&rdquo; By substituting
&ldquo;rivers&rdquo; only for &ldquo;rivers of waters&rdquo; the
text may have gained in exactness, but it has lost immeasurably,
both in poetry and in sound. Far more poetical is the verse as
given in the Douai version: &ldquo;His eyes are as doves upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name=
"page103">[103]</a></span>brooks of waters, which are washed with
milk, and sit beside the beautiful streams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may even be said without any question that the mistakes of
the old translators were often much more beautiful than the
original. A splendid example is given in the verse of Job, chapter
twenty-six, verse thirteen: &ldquo;By his spirit he hath garnished
the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.&rdquo; By
the crooked serpent was supposed to be signified the grand
constellation called <em>Draco</em>, or the Dragon. And the figure
is sublime. It is still more sublime in the Douai translation.
&ldquo;His obstetric hand hath brought forth the Winding
Serpent.&rdquo; This is certainly a grand imagination&mdash;the
hand of God, like the hand of a midwife, bringing forth a
constellation out of the womb of the eternal night. But in the
revised version, which is exact, we have only &ldquo;His hand hath
pierced the Swift Serpent!&rdquo; All the poetry is dead.</p>
<p>There are two methods for the literary study of any
book&mdash;the first being the study of its thought and emotion;
the second only that of its workmanship. A student of literature
should study some of the Bible from both points of view. In
attempting the former method he will do well to consider many works
of criticism, but for the study of the text as literature, his duty
is very plain&mdash;the King James version is the only one that
ought to form the basis of his study, though he <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104">[104]</a></span>should
look at the Douai version occasionally. Also he should have a book
of references, such as Cruden&rsquo;s Concordance, by help of which
he can collect together in a few moments all the texts upon any
particular subject, such as the sea, the wind, the sky, human life,
the shadows of evening. The study of the Bible is not one which I
should recommend to very young Japanese students, because of the
quaintness of the English. Before a good knowledge of English forms
is obtained, the archaisms are apt to affect the students&rsquo;
mode of expression. But for the advanced student of literature, I
should say that some knowledge of the finest books in the Bible is
simply indispensable. The important books to read are not many. But
one should read at least the books of Genesis, Exodus, Ruth,
Esther, the Song of Songs, Proverbs,&mdash;and, above all, Job. Job
is certainly the grandest book in the Bible; but all of those which
I have named are books that have inspired poets and writers in all
departments of English literature to such an extent that you can
scarcely read a masterpiece in which there is not some conscious or
unconscious reference to them. Another book of philosophical
importance is Ecclesiastes, where, in addition to much proverbial
wisdom, you will find some admirable world-poetry&mdash;that is,
poetry which contains universal truth about human life in all times
and all ages. Of the historical books and the law books I do not
think that it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name=
"page105">[105]</a></span>important to read much; the literary
element in these is not so pronounced. It is otherwise with the
prophetic books, but here in order to obtain a few jewels of
expression, you have to read a great deal that is of little value.
Of the New Testament there is very little equal to the Old in
literary value; indeed, I should recommend the reading only of the
closing book&mdash;the book called the Revelation, or the
Apocalypse, from which we have derived a literary adjective
&ldquo;apocalyptic,&rdquo; to describe something at once very
terrible and very grand. Whether one understands the meaning of
this mysterious text makes very little difference; the sonority and
the beauty of its sentences, together with the tremendous character
of its imagery, can not but powerfully influence mind and ear, and
thus stimulate literary taste. At least two of the great prose
writers of the nineteenth century, Carlyle and Ruskin, have been
vividly influenced by the book of the Revelation. Every period of
English literature shows some influence of Bible study, even from
the old Anglo-Saxon days; and during the present year, the study
has so little slackened that one constantly sees announcements of
new works upon the literary elements of the Bible. Perhaps one of
the best is Professor Moulton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Modern Reader&rsquo;s
Bible,&rdquo; in which the literary side of the subject receives
better consideration than in any other work of the kind published
for general use.</p>

<h2>The &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>Old Northern Ethics of Life</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then from his lips in music rolled</p>
<p>The Havamal of Odin old,</p>
<p>With sounds mysterious as the roar</p>
<p>Of billows on a distant shore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps many of you who read this little verse in
Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Saga of King Olaf&rdquo; have wished to
know what was this wonderful song that the ghost of the god sang to
the king. I am afraid that you would be very disappointed in some
respects by the &ldquo;Havamal.&rdquo; There is indeed a magical
song in it; and it is this magical song especially that Longfellow
refers to, a song of charms. But most of the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo;
is a collection of ethical teaching. All that has been preserved by
it has been published and translated by Professors Vigfusson and
Powell. It is very old&mdash;perhaps the oldest Northern literature
that we have. I am going to attempt a short lecture upon it,
because it is very closely related to the subject of Northern
character, and will help us, perhaps better than almost anything
else, to understand how the ancestors of the English felt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name=
"page107">[107]</a></span>and thought before they became
Christians. Nor is this all. I venture to say that the character of
the modern English people still retains much more of the quality
indicated by the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; than of the quality implied
by Christianity. The old Northern gods are not dead; they rule a
very great part of the world to-day.</p>
<p>The proverbial philosophy of a people helps us to understand
more about them than any other kind of literature. And this sort of
literature is certainly among the oldest. It represents only the
result of human experience in society, the wisdom that men get by
contact with each other, the results of familiarity with right and
wrong. By studying the proverbs of a people, you can always make a
very good guess as to whether you could live comfortably among them
or not.</p>
<p>Froude, in one of his sketches of travel in Norway, made the
excellent observation that if we could suddenly go back to the time
of the terrible sea-kings, if we could revisit to-day the homes of
the old Northern pirates, and find them exactly as they were one
thousand or fifteen hundred years ago, we should find them very
much like the modern Englishmen&mdash;big, simple, silent men,
concealing a great deal of shrewdness under an aspect of
simplicity. The teachings of the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; give great
force to this supposition. The book must have been known in some
form to the early English&mdash;or at least the verses composing it
(it is all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name=
"page108">[108]</a></span>written in verse); and as I have already
said, the morals of the old English, as well as their character,
differed very little from those of the men of the still further
North, with whom they mingled and intermarried freely, both before
and after the Danish conquest, when for one moment England and
Sweden were one kingdom.</p>
<p>Of course you must remember that Northern society was a very
terrible thing in some ways. Every man carried his life in his
hands; every farmer kept sword and spear at his side even in his
own fields; and every man expected to die fighting. In fact, among
the men of the more savage North&mdash;the men of Norway in
especial&mdash;it was considered a great disgrace to die of
sickness, to die on one&rsquo;s bed. That was not to die like a
man. Men would go out and get themselves killed, when they felt old
age or sickness coming on. But these facts must not blind us to the
other fact that there was even in that society a great force of
moral cohesion, and sound principles of morality. If there had not
been, it could not have existed; much less could the people who
lived under it have become the masters of a great part of the
world, which they are at the present day. There was, in spite of
all that fierceness, much kindness and good nature among them;
there were rules of conduct such as no man could find fault
with&mdash;rules which still govern English society to some extent.
And there was opportunity enough <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page109" name="page109">[109]</a></span>for social amusement,
social enjoyment, and the winning of public esteem by a noble
life.</p>
<p>Still, even in the &ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; one is occasionally
startled by teachings which show the darker side of Northern life,
a life of perpetual vendetta. As in old Japan, no man could live
under the same heaven with the murderer of his brother or father;
vengeance was a duty even in the case of a friend. On the subject
of enemies the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; gives not a little curious
advice:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>A man should never step a foot beyond his weapons; for he can
never tell where, on his path without, he may need his spear.</p>
<p>A man, before he goes into a house, should look to and espy all
the doorways (<em>so that he can find his way out quickly
again</em>), for he can never know where foes may be sitting in
another man&rsquo;s house.</p>
</div>
<p>Does not this remind us of the Japanese proverb that everybody
has three enemies outside of his own door? But the meaning of the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; teaching is much more sinister. And when the
man goes into the house, he is still told to be extremely
watchful&mdash;to keep his ears and eyes open so that he may not be
taken by surprise:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>The wary guest keeps watchful silence; he listens with his ears
and peers about with his eyes; thus does every wise man look about
him.</p>
</div>
<p>One would think that men must have had very strong nerves to
take comfort under such circumstances, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page110" name="page110">[110]</a></span>but the poet tells us that
the man who can enjoy nothing must be both a coward and a fool.
Although a man was to keep watch to protect his life, that was not
a reason why he should be afraid of losing it. There were but three
things of which a man should be particularly afraid. The first was
drink&mdash;because drink often caused a man to lose control of his
temper; the second was another man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;repeatedly
the reader is warned never to make love to another man&rsquo;s
wife; and the third was thieves&mdash;men who would pretend
friendship for the purpose of killing and stealing, The man who
could keep constant watch over himself and his surroundings was, of
course, likely to have the longest life.</p>
<p>Now in all countries there is a great deal of ethical teaching,
and always has been, on the subject of speech. The
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; is full of teaching on this subject&mdash;the
necessity of silence, the danger and the folly of reckless talk.
You all know the Japanese proverb that &ldquo;the mouth is the
front gate of all misfortune.&rdquo; The Norse poet puts the same
truth into a grimmer shape: &ldquo;The tongue works death to the
head.&rdquo; Here are a number of sayings on this subject:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>He that is never silent talks much folly; a glib tongue, unless
it be bridled, will often talk a man into trouble.</p>
<p>Do not speak three angry words with a worse man; for often the
better man falls by the worse man&rsquo;s sword.</p>
<p>Smile thou in the face of the man thou trusteth not, and speak
against thy mind.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name=
"page111">[111]</a></span>This is of course a teaching of cunning;
but it is the teaching, however immoral, that rules in English
society to-day. In the old Norse, however, there were many reasons
for avoiding a quarrel whenever possible&mdash;reasons which must
have existed also in feudal Japan. A man might not care about
losing his own life; but he had to be careful not to stir up a feud
that might go on for a hundred years. Although there was a great
deal of killing, killing always remained a serious matter, because
for every killing there had to be a vengeance. It is true that the
law exonerated the man who killed another, if he paid a certain
blood-price; murder was not legally considered an unpardonable
crime. But the family of the dead man would very seldom be
satisfied with a payment; they would want blood for blood.
Accordingly men had to be very cautious about quarreling, however
brave they might personally be.</p>
<p>But all this caution about silence and about watchfulness did
not mean that a man should be unable to speak to the purpose when
speech was required. &ldquo;A wise man,&rdquo; says the
&ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; &ldquo;should be able both to ask and to
answer.&rdquo; There is a proverb which you know, to the effect
that you can not shut the door upon another man&rsquo;s mouth. So
says the Norse poet: &ldquo;The sons of men can keep silence about
nothing that passes among men; therefore a man should be able to
take his own part, prudently and strongly.&rdquo; Says <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112">[112]</a></span>the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo;: &ldquo;A fool thinks he knows everything if
he sits snug in his little corner; but he is at a loss for words if
the people put to him a question.&rdquo; Elsewhere it is said:
&ldquo;Arch dunce is he who can speak nought, for that is the mark
of a fool.&rdquo; And the sum of all this teaching about the tongue
is that men should never speak without good reason, and then should
speak to the point strongly and wisely.</p>
<p>On the subject of fools there is a great deal in the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo;; but you must understand always by the word
fool, in the Northern sense, a man of weak character who knows not
what to do in time of difficulty. That was a fool among those men,
and a dangerous fool; for in such a state of society mistakes in
act or in speech might reach to terrible consequences. See these
little observations about fools:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Open-handed, bold-hearted men live most happily, they never feel
care; but a fool troubles himself about everything. The niggard
pines for gifts.</p>
<p>A fool is awake all night, worrying about everything; when the
morning comes he is worn out, and all his troubles are just the
same as before.</p>
<p>A fool thinks that all who smile upon him are his friends, not
knowing, when he is with wise men, who there may be plotting
against him.</p>
<p>If a fool gets a drink, all his mind is immediately
displayed.</p>
</div>
<p>But it was not considered right for a man not <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113">[113]</a></span>to drink,
although drink was a dangerous thing. On the contrary, not to drink
would have been thought a mark of cowardice and of incapacity for
self-control. A man was expected even to get drunk if necessary,
and to keep his tongue and his temper no matter how much he drank.
The strong character would only become more cautious and more
silent under the influence of drink; the weak man would immediately
show his weakness. I am told the curious fact that in the English
army at the present day officers are expected to act very much
after the teaching of the old Norse poet; a man is expected to be
able on occasion to drink a considerable amount of wine or spirits
without showing the effects of it, either in his conduct or in his
speech. &ldquo;Drink thy share of mead; speak fair or not at
all&rdquo;&mdash;that was the old text, and a very sensible one in
its way.</p>
<p>Laughter was also condemned, if indulged in without very good
cause. &ldquo;The miserable man whose mind is warped laughs at
everything, not knowing what he ought to know, that he himself has
no lack of faults.&rdquo; I need scarcely tell you that the English
are still a very serious people, not disposed to laugh nearly so
much as are the men of the more sympathetic Latin races. You will
remember perhaps Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s saying that since he
became a man no man had ever seen him laugh. I remember about
twenty years ago that there was published by some Englishman a very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name=
"page114">[114]</a></span>learned and very interesting little book,
called &ldquo;The Philosophy of Laughter,&rdquo; in which it was
gravely asserted that all laughter was foolish. I must acknowledge,
however, that no book ever made me laugh more than the volume in
question.</p>
<p>The great virtue of the men of the North, according to the
&ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; was indeed the virtue which has given to the
English race its present great position among nations,&mdash;the
simplest of all virtues, common sense. But common sense means much
more than the words might imply to the Japanese students, or to any
one unfamiliar with English idioms. Common sense, or mother-wit,
means natural intelligence, as opposed to, and independent of,
cultivated or educated intelligence. It means inherited knowledge;
and inherited knowledge may take even the form of genius. It means
foresight. It means intuitive knowledge of other people&rsquo;s
character. It means cunning as well as broad comprehension. And the
modern Englishman, in all times and in all countries, trusts
especially to this faculty, which is very largely developed in the
race to which he belongs. No Englishman believes in working from
book learning. He suspects all theories, philosophical or other. He
suspects everything new, and dislikes it, unless he can be
compelled by the force of circumstances to see that this new thing
has advantages over the old. Race-experience is what he invariably
depends upon, whenever he can, whether in India, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115">[115]</a></span>in Egypt,
or in Australia. His statesmen do not consult historical precedents
in order to decide what to do: they first learn the facts as they
are; then they depend upon their own common sense, not at all upon
their university learning or upon philosophical theories. And in
the case of the English nation, it must be acknowledged that this
instinctive method has been eminently successful. When the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; speaks of wisdom it means mother-wit, and
nothing else; indeed, there was no reading or writing to speak of
in those times:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>No man can carry better baggage on his journey than wisdom.</p>
<p>There is no better friend than great common sense.</p>
</div>
<p>But the wise man should not show himself to be wise without
occasion. He should remember that the majority of men are not wise,
and he should be careful not to show his superiority over them
unnecessarily. Neither should be despise men who do not happen to
be as wise as himself:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>No man is so good but there is a flaw in him, nor so bad as to
be good for nothing.</p>
<p>Middling wise should every man be; never overwise. Those who
know many things rarely lead the happiest life.</p>
<p>Middling wise should every man be; never overwise. No man should
know his fate beforehand; so shall he live freest from care.</p>
<p>Middling wise should every man be, never too wise. A wise
man&rsquo;s heart is seldom glad, if its owner be a true sage.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name=
"page116">[116]</a></span>This is the ancient wisdom also of
Solomon &ldquo;He that increases wisdom increases sorrow.&rdquo;
But how very true as worldly wisdom these little Northern sentences
are. That a man who knows a little of many things, and no one thing
perfectly, is the happiest man&mdash;this certainly is even more
true to-day than it was a thousand years ago. Spencer has well
observed that the man who can influence his generation, is never
the man greatly in advance of his time, but only the man who is
very slightly better than his fellows. The man who is very superior
is likely to be ignored or disliked. Mediocrity can not help
disliking superiority; and as the old Northern sage declared,
&ldquo;the average of men is but moiety.&rdquo; Moiety does not
mean necessarily mediocrity, but also that which is below
mediocrity. What we call in England to-day, as Matthew Arnold
called it, the Philistine element, continues to prove in our own
time, to almost every superior man, the danger of being too
wise.</p>
<p>Interesting in another way, and altogether more agreeable, are
the old sayings about friendship: &ldquo;Know this, if thou hast a
trusty friend, go and see him often; because a road which is seldom
trod gets choked with brambles and high grass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Be not thou the first to break off from thy friend. Sorrow will
eat thy heart if thou lackest the friend to open thy heart to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name=
"page117">[117]</a></span>Anything is better than to be false; he
is no friend who only speaks to please.</p>
</div>
<p>Which means, of course, that a true friend is not afraid to find
fault with his friend&rsquo;s course; indeed, that is his solemn
duty. But these teachings about friendship are accompanied with
many cautions; for one must be very careful in the making friends.
The ancient Greeks had a terrible proverb: &ldquo;Treat your friend
as if he should become some day your enemy; and treat your enemy as
if he might some day become your friend.&rdquo; This proverb seems
to me to indicate a certain amount of doubt in human nature. We do
not find this doubt in the Norse teaching, but on the contrary,
some very excellent advice. The first thing to remember is that
friendship is sacred: &ldquo;He that opens his heart to another
mixes blood with him.&rdquo; Therefore one should be very careful
either about forming or about breaking a friendship.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>A man should be a friend to his friend&rsquo;s friend. But no
man should be a friend of his friend&rsquo;s foe, nor of his
foe&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>A man should be a friend with his friend, and pay back gift with
gift; give back laughter for laughter (to his enemies), and lesing
for lies.</p>
<p>Give and give back makes the longest friend. Give not overmuch
at one time. Gift always looks for return.</p>
</div>
<p>The poet also tells us how trifling gifts are quite <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118">[118]</a></span>sufficient
to make friends and to keep them, if wisely given. A costly gift
may seem like a bribe; a little gift is only the sign of kindly
feeling. And as a mere matter of justice, a costly gift may be
unkind, for it puts the friend under an obligation which he may not
be rich enough to repay. Repeatedly we are told also that too much
should not be expected of friendship. The value of a friend is his
affection, his sympathy; but favours that cost must always be
returned.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>I never met a man so open-hearted and free with his food, but
that boon was boon to him&mdash;nor so generous as not to look for
return if he had a chance.</p>
</div>
<p>Emerson says almost precisely the same thing in his essay on
friendship&mdash;showing how little human wisdom has changed in all
the centuries. Here is another good bit of advice concerning
visits:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>It is far away to an ill friend, even though he live on
one&rsquo;s road; but to a good friend there is a short cut, even
though he live far out.</p>
<p>Go on, be not a guest ever in the same house. The welcome
becomes wearisome if he sits too long at another&rsquo;s table.</p>
</div>
<p>This means that we must not impose on our friends; but there is
a further caution on the subject of eating at a friend&rsquo;s
house. You must not go to your friend&rsquo;s house hungry, when
you can help it.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name=
"page119">[119]</a></span>A man should take his meal betimes,
before he goes to his neighbour&mdash;or he will sit and seem
hungered like one starving, and have no power to talk.</p>
</div>
<p>That is the main point to remember in dining at another&rsquo;s
house, that you are not there only for your own pleasure, but for
that of other people. You are expected to talk; and you can not
talk if you are very hungry. At this very day a gentleman makes it
the rule to do the same thing. Accordingly we see that these rough
men of the North must have had a good deal of social
refinement&mdash;refinement not of dress or of speech, but of
feeling. Still, says the poet, one&rsquo;s own home is the best,
though it be but a cottage. &ldquo;A man is a man in his own
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we come to some sentences teaching caution, which are
noteworthy in a certain way:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Tell one man thy secret, but not two. What three men know, all
the world knows.</p>
<p>Never let a bad man know thy mishaps; for from a bad man thou
shalt never get reward for thy sincerity.</p>
</div>
<p>I shall presently give you some modern examples in regard to the
advice concerning bad men. Another thing to be cautious about is
praise. If you have to be careful about blame, you must be very
cautious also about praise.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Praise the day at even-tide; a woman at her burying; a sword
when it has been tried; a maid when she is married; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120">[120]</a></span>ice when
you have crossed over it; ale when it is drunk.</p>
</div>
<p>If there is anything noteworthy in English character to-day it
is the exemplification of this very kind of teaching. This is
essentially Northern. The last people from whom praise can be
expected, even for what is worthy of all praise, are the English. A
new friendship, a new ideal, a reform, a noble action, a wonderful
poet, an exquisite painting&mdash;any of these things will be
admired and praised by every other people in Europe long before you
can get Englishmen to praise. The Englishman all this time is
studying, considering, trying to find fault. Why should he try to
find fault? So that he will not make any mistakes at a later day.
He has inherited the terrible caution of his ancestors in regard to
mistakes. It must be granted that his caution has saved him from a
number of very serious mistakes that other nations have made. It
must also be acknowledged that he exercises a fair amount of
moderation in the opposite direction&mdash;this modern Englishman;
he has learned caution of another kind, which his ancestors taught
him. &ldquo;Power,&rdquo; says the &ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;should be used with moderation; for whoever finds himself
among valiant men will discover that no man is peerless.&rdquo; And
this is a very important thing for the strong man to
know&mdash;that however strong, he can not be the strongest; his
match will be found when occasion demands it. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121">[121]</a></span>Not only
Scandinavian but English rulers have often discovered this fact to
their cost. Another matter to be very anxious about is public
opinion.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Chattels die; kinsmen pass away; one dies oneself; but I know
something that never dies&mdash;the name of the man, for good or
bad.</p>
</div>
<p>Do not think that this means anything religious. It means only
that the reputation of a man goes to influence the good or ill
fortune of his descendants. It is something to be proud of, to be
the son of a good man; it helps to success in life. On the other
hand, to have had a father of ill reputation is a very serious
obstacle to success of any kind in countries where the influence of
heredity is strongly recognized.</p>
<p>I have nearly exhausted the examples of this Northern wisdom
which I selected for you; but there are two subjects which remain
to be considered. One is the law of conduct in regard to
misfortune; and the other is the rule of conduct in regard to
women. A man was expected to keep up a brave heart under any
circumstances. These old Northmen seldom committed suicide; and I
must tell you that all the talk about Christianity having checked
the practice of suicide to some extent, can not be fairly accepted
as truth. In modern England to-day the suicides average nearly
three thousand a year; but making allowance for extraordinary
circumstances, it is certainly true <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page122" name="page122">[122]</a></span>that the Northern races
consider suicide in an entirely different way from what the Latin
races do. There was very little suicide among the men of the North,
because every man considered it his duty to get killed, not to kill
himself; and to kill himself would have seemed cowardly, as
implying fear of being killed by others. In modern ethical
training, quite apart from religious considerations a man is taught
that suicide is only excusable in case of shame, or under such
exceptional circumstances as have occurred in the history of the
Indian mutiny. At all events, we have the feeling still strongly
manifested in England that suicide is not quite manly; and this is
certainly due much more to ancestral habits of thinking, which date
back to pagan days, than to Christian doctrine. As I have said, the
pagan English would not commit suicide to escape mere pain. But the
Northern people knew how to die to escape shame. There is an awful
story in Roman history about the wives and daughters of the
conquered German tribes, thousands in number, asking to be promised
that their virtue should be respected, and all killing themselves
when the Roman general refused the request. No Southern people of
Europe in that time would have shown such heroism upon such a
matter. Leaving honour aside, however, the old book tells us that a
man should never despair.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name=
"page123">[123]</a></span>Fire, the sight of the sun, good health,
and a blameless life these are the goodliest things in this
world.</p>
<p>Yet a man is not utterly wretched, though he have bad health, or
be maimed.</p>
<p>The halt may ride a horse; the handless may drive a herd; the
deaf can fight and do well; better be blind than buried. A corpse
is good for naught.</p>
</div>
<p>On the subject of women there is not very much in the book
beyond the usual caution in regard to wicked women; but there is
this little observation:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Never blame a woman for what is all man&rsquo;s weakness. Hues
charming and fair may move the wise and not the dullard. Mighty
love turns the son of men from wise to fool.</p>
</div>
<p>This is shrewd, and it contains a very remarkable bit of
esthetic truth, that it requires a wise man to see certain kinds of
beauty, which a stupid man could never be made to understand. And,
leaving aside the subject of love, what very good advice it is
never to laugh at a person for what can be considered a common
failure. In the same way an intelligent man should learn to be
patient with the unintelligent, as the same poem elsewhere
insists.</p>
<p>Now what is the general result of this little study, the general
impression that it leaves upon the mind? Certainly we feel that the
life reflected in these sentences was a life in which caution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name=
"page124">[124]</a></span>was above all things
necessary&mdash;caution in thought and speech and act, never
ceasing, by night or day, during the whole of a man&rsquo;s life.
Caution implies moderation. Moderation inevitably develops a
certain habit of justice&mdash;a justice that might not extend
outside of the race, but a justice that would be exercised between
man and man of the same blood. Very much of English character and
of English history is explained by the life that the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; portrays. Very much that is good; also very
much that is bad&mdash;not bad in one sense, so far as the future
of the race is concerned, but in a social way certainly not good.
The judgment of the Englishman by all other European peoples is
that he is the most suspicious, the most reserved, the most
unreceptive, the most unfriendly, the coldest hearted, and the most
domineering of all Western peoples. Ask a Frenchman, an Italian, a
German, a Spaniard, even an American, what he thinks about
Englishmen; and every one of them will tell you the very same
thing. This is precisely what the character of men would become who
had lived for thousands of years in the conditions of Northern
society. But you would find upon the other hand that nearly all
nations would speak highly of certain other English
qualities&mdash;energy, courage, honour, justice (between
themselves). They would say that although no man is so difficult to
make friends with, the friendship of an <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125">[125]</a></span>Englishman
once gained is more strong and true than any other. And as the
battle of life still continues, and must continue for thousands of
years to come, it must be acknowledged that the English character
is especially well fitted for the struggle. Its reserves, its
cautions, its doubts, its suspicions, its brutality&mdash;these
have been for it in the past, and are still in the present, the
best social armour and panoply of war. It is not a lovable nor an
amiable character; it is not even kindly. The Englishman of the
best type is much more inclined to be just than he is to be kind,
for kindness is an emotional impulse, and the Englishman is on his
guard against every kind of emotional impulse. But with all this,
the character is a grand one, and its success has been the best
proof of its value.</p>
<p>Now you will have observed in the reading of this ancient code
of social morals that, while none of the teaching is religious,
some of it is absolutely immoral from any religious standpoint. No
great religion permits us to speak what is not true, and to smile
in the face of an enemy while pretending to be his friend. No
religion teaches that we should &ldquo;pay back lesing for
lies.&rdquo; Neither does a religion tell us that we should expect
a return for every kindness done; that we should regard friendship
as being actuated by selfish motives; that we should never praise
when praise seems to be deserved. In fact, when Sir Walter Scott
long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name=
"page126">[126]</a></span>ago made a partial translation of the
&ldquo;Havamal,&rdquo; he thought himself obliged to leave out a
number of sentences which seemed to him highly immoral, and to
apologize for others. He thought that they would shock English
readers too much.</p>
<p>We are not quite so squeamish to-day; and a thinker of our own
time would scarcely deny that English society is very largely
governed at this moment by the same kind of rules that Sir Walter
Scott thought to be so bad. But here we need not condemn English
society in particular. All European society has been for hundreds
of years conducting itself upon very much the same principles; for
the reason that human social experience has been the same in all
Western countries. I should say that the only difference between
English society and other societies is that the hardness of
character is very much greater. Let us go back even to the most
Christian times of Western societies in the most Christian country
of Europe, and observe whether the social code was then and there
so very different from the social code of the old
&ldquo;Havamal.&rdquo; Mr. Spencer observes in his
&ldquo;Ethics&rdquo; that, so far as the conduct of life is
concerned, religion is almost nothing and practice is everything.
We find this wonderfully exemplified in a most remarkable book of
social precepts written in the seventeenth century, in Spain, under
the title of the &ldquo;Oraculo Manual.&rdquo; It was composed by a
Spanish priest, named Baltasar Gracian, who <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127">[127]</a></span>was born
in the year 1601 and died in 1658; and it has been translated into
nearly all languages. The best English translation, published by
Macmillan, is called &ldquo;The Art of Worldly Wisdom.&rdquo; It is
even more admired to-day than in the seventeenth century; and what
it teaches as to social conduct holds as good to-day of modern
society as it did of society two hundred years ago. It is one of
the most unpleasant and yet interesting books ever
published&mdash;unpleasant because of the malicious cunning which
it often displays&mdash;interesting because of the frightful
perspicacity of the author. The man who wrote that book understood
the hearts of men, especially the bad side. He was a gentleman of
high rank before he became a priest, and his instinctive shrewdness
must have been hereditary. Religion, this man would have said,
teaches the best possible morals; but the world is not governed by
religion altogether, and to mix with it, we must act according to
its dictates.</p>
<p>These dictates remind us in many ways of the cautions and the
cunning of the &ldquo;Havamal.&rdquo; The first thing enjoined upon
a man both by the Norse writer and by the Spanish author is the art
of silence. Probably this has been the result of social experience
in all countries. &ldquo;Cautious silence is the holy of holies of
worldly wisdom,&rdquo; says Gracian. And he gives many elaborate
reasons for this statement, not the least of which is the
following: &ldquo;If you do not declare yourself immediately,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name=
"page128">[128]</a></span>you arouse expectation, especially when
the importance of your position makes you the object of general
attention. Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very
mystery arouses veneration.&rdquo; A little further on he gives us
exactly the same advice as did the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; writer, in
regard to being frank with enemies. &ldquo;Do not,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;show your wounded finger, for everything will knock up
against it; nor complain about it, for malice always aims where
weakness can be injured&hellip;. Never disclose the source of
mortification or of joy, if you wish the one to cease, the other to
endure.&rdquo; About secrets the Spaniard is quite as cautious as
the Norseman. He says, &ldquo;Especially dangerous are secrets
entrusted to friends. He that communicates his secret to another
makes himself that other man&rsquo;s slave.&rdquo; But after a
great many such cautions in regard to silence and secrecy, he tells
us also that we must learn how to fight with the world. You
remember the advice of the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; on this subject,
how it condemns as a fool the man who can not answer a reproach.
The Spaniard is, however, much more malicious in his suggestions.
He tells as that we must &ldquo;learn to know every man&rsquo;s
thumbscrew.&rdquo; I suppose you know that a thumbscrew was an
instrument of torture used in old times to force confessions from
criminals. This advice means nothing less than that we should learn
how <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name=
"page129">[129]</a></span>to be be able to hurt other men&rsquo;s
feelings, or to flatter other men&rsquo;s weaknesses. &ldquo;First
guess every man&rsquo;s ruling passion, appeal to it by a word, set
it in motion by temptation, and you will infallibly give checkmate
to his freedom of will.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;give
checkmate&rdquo; is taken from the game of chess, and must here be
understood as meaning to overcome, to conquer. A kindred piece of
advice is &ldquo;keep a store of sarcasms, and know how to use
them.&rdquo; Indeed he tells us that this is the point of greatest
tact in human intercourse. &ldquo;Struck by the slightest word of
this kind, many fall away from the closest intimacy with superiors
or inferiors, which intimacy could not be in the slightest shaken
by a whole conspiracy of popular insinuation or private
malevolence.&rdquo; In other words, you can more quickly destroy a
man&rsquo;s friendship by one word of sarcasm than by any amount of
intrigue. Does not this read very much like sheer wickedness?
Certainly it does; but the author would have told you that you must
fight the wicked with their own weapons. In the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; you will not find anything quite so openly
wicked as that; but we must suppose that the Norsemen knew the
secret, though they might not have put it into words. As for the
social teaching, you will find it very subtly expressed even in the
modern English novels of George Meredith, who, by the way, has
written a poem in praise of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"
name="page130">[130]</a></span>sarcasm and ridicule. But let us now
see what the Spanish author has to tell us about friendship and
unselfishness.</p>
<p>The shrewd man knows that others when they seek him do not seek
&ldquo;him,&rdquo; but &ldquo;their advantage in him and by
him.&rdquo; That is to say, a shrewd man does not believe in
disinterested friendship. This is much worse than anything in the
&ldquo;Havamal.&rdquo; And it is diabolically elaborated. What are
we to say about such teaching as the following: &ldquo;A wise man
would rather see men needing him than thanking him. To keep them on
the threshold of hope is diplomatic; to trust to their gratitude is
boorish; hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one&rdquo;? There
is much more of this kind; but after the assurance that only a
boorish person (that is to say, an ignorant and vulgar man) can
believe in gratitude, the author&rsquo;s opinion of human nature
needs no further elucidation. The old Norseman would have been
shocked at such a statement. But he might have approved the
following: &ldquo;When you hear anything favourable, keep a tight
rein upon your credulity; if unfavourable, give it the spur.&rdquo;
That is to say, when you hear anything good about another man, do
not be ready to believe it; but if you hear anything bad about him,
believe as much of it as you can.</p>
<p>I notice also many other points of resemblance between the
Northern and the Spanish teaching in regard to caution. The
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; says that you <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page131" name="page131">[131]</a></span>must not pick a quarrel
with a worse man than yourself; &ldquo;because the better man often
falls by the worse man&rsquo;s sword.&rdquo; The Spanish priest
gives a still shrewder reason for the same policy. &ldquo;Never
contend,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with a man who has nothing to lose;
for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters
without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no
further loss to fear.&rdquo; I think that this is an immoral
teaching, though a very prudent one; but I need scarcely to tell
you that it is still a principle in modern society not to contend
with a man who has no reputation to lose. I think it is immoral,
because it is purely selfish, and because a good man ought not to
be afraid to denounce a wrong because of making enemies. Another
point, however, on which the &ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; and the priest
agree, is more commendable and interesting. &ldquo;We do not think
much of a man who never contradicts us; that is no sign he loves
us, but rather a sign that he loves himself. Original and
out-of-the-way views are signs of superior ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should not like you to suppose, however, that the whole of the
book from which I have been quoting is of the same character as the
quotations. There is excellent advice in it; and much kindly
teaching on the subject of generous acts. It is a book both good
and bad, and never stupid. The same man who tells you that
friendship is seldom unselfish, also declares that life would be a
desert <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name=
"page132">[132]</a></span>without friends, and that there is no
magic like a good turn&mdash;that is, a kind act. He teaches the
importance of getting good will by honest means, although he
advises us also to learn how to injure. I am sure that nobody could
read the book without benefit. And I may close these quotations
from it with the following paragraph, which is the very best bit of
counsel that could be given to a literary student:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Be slow and sure. Quickly done can be quickly undone. To last an
eternity requires an eternity of preparation. Only excellence
counts. Profound intelligence is the only foundation for
immortality. Worth much costs much. The precious metals are the
heaviest.</p>
</div>
<p>But so far as the question of human conduct is concerned, the
book of Gracian is no more of a religious book than is the
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; of the heathen North. You would find, were
such a book published to-day and brought up to the present time by
any shrewd writer, that Western morality has not improved in the
least since the time before Christianity was established, so far as
the rules of society go. Society is not, and can not be, religious,
because it is a state of continual warfare. Every person in it has
to fight, and the battle is not less cruel now because it is not
fought with swords. Indeed, I should think that the time when every
man carried his sword in society was a time when men were quite as
kindly and much more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name=
"page133">[133]</a></span>honest than they are now. The object of
this little lecture was to show you that the principles of the
ancient Norse are really the principles ruling English society
to-day; but I think you will be able to take from it a still larger
meaning. It is that not only one form of society, but all forms of
society, represent the warfare of man and man. That is why
thinkers, poets, philosophers, in all ages, have tried to find
solitude, to keep out of the contest, to devote themselves only to
study of the beautiful and the true. But the prizes of life are not
to be obtained in solitude, although the prizes of thought can only
there be won. After all, whatever we may think about the cruelty
and treachery of the social world, it does great things in the end.
It quickens judgment, deepens intelligence, enforces the
acquisition of self-control, creates forms of mental and moral
strength that can not fail to be sometimes of vast importance to
mankind. But if you should ask me whether it increases human
happiness, I should certainly say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;Havamal&rdquo; said the same thing,&mdash;the truly wise man
can not be happy.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_8" name="Ch_8">Chapter VIII</a></h3>
<h2>Beyond Man</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It seems to me a lecturer&rsquo;s duty to speak to you about any
remarkable thought at this moment engaging the attention of Western
philosophers and men of science,&mdash;partly because any such new
ideas are certain, sooner or later, to be reflected in literature,
and partly because without a knowledge of them you might form
incorrect ideas in relation to utterances of any important
philosophic character. I am not going to discourse about Nietzsche,
though the title of this lecture is taken from one of his books;
the ideas about which I am going to tell you, you will not find in
his books. It is most extraordinary, to my thinking, that these
ideas never occurred to him, for he was an eminent man of science
before writing his probably insane books. I have not the slightest
sympathy with most of his ideas; they seem to me misinterpretations
of evolutional teachings; and if not misinterpretations, they are
simply undeveloped and ill-balanced thinking. But the title of one
of his books, and the idea which he tries always unsuccessfully to
explain,&mdash;that of a state above mankind, a moral condition
&ldquo;beyond man,&rdquo; as he <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page135" name="page135">[135]</a></span>calls it,&mdash;that is
worth talking about. It is not nonsense at all, but fact, and I
think that I can give you a correct idea of the realities in the
case. Leaving Nietzsche entirely alone, then, let us ask if it is
possible to suppose a condition of human existence above
morality,&mdash;that is to say, more moral than the most moral
ideal which a human brain can conceive? We may answer, it is quite
possible, and it is not only possible, but it has actually been
predicted by many great thinkers, including Herbert Spencer.</p>
<p>We have been brought up to think that there can be nothing
better than virtue, than duty, than strictly following the precepts
of a good religion. However, our ideas of goodness and of virtue
necessarily imply the existence of the opposite qualities. To do a
good thing because it is our duty to do it, implies a certain
amount of resolve, a struggle against difficulty. The virtue of
honesty is a term implying the difficulty of being perfectly
honest. When we think of any virtuous or great deed, we can not
help thinking of the pain and obstacles that have to be met with in
performing that deed. All our active morality is a struggle against
immorality. And I think that, as every religion teaches, it must be
granted that no human being has a perfectly moral nature.</p>
<p>Could a world exist in which the nature of all the inhabitants
would be so moral that the mere idea of what is immoral could not
exist? Let me <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name=
"page136">[136]</a></span>explain my question more in detail.
Imagine a society in which the idea of dishonesty would not exist,
because no person could be dishonest, a society in which the idea
of unchastity could not exist, because no person could possibly be
unchaste, a world in which no one could have any idea of envy,
ambition or anger, because such passions could not exist, a world
in which there would be no idea of duty, filial or parental,
because not to be filial, not to be loving, not to do everything
which we human beings now call duty, would be impossible. In such a
world ideas of duty would be quite useless; for every action of
existence would represent the constant and faultless performance of
what we term duty. Moreover, there would be no difficulty, no pain
in such performance; it would be the constant and unfailing
pleasure of life. With us, unfortunately, what is wrong often gives
pleasure; and what is good to do, commonly causes pain. But in the
world which I am asking you to imagine there could not be any
wrong, nor any pleasure in wrong-doing; all the pleasure would be
in right-doing. To give a very simple illustration&mdash;one of the
commonest and most pardonable faults of young people is eating,
drinking, or sleeping too much. But in our imaginary world to eat
or to drink or to sleep in even the least degree more than is
necessary could not be done; the constitution of the race would not
permit it. One more illustration. Our children <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137">[137]</a></span>have to be
educated carefully in regard to what is right or wrong; in the
world of which I am speaking, no time would be wasted in any such
education, for every child would be born with full knowledge of
what is right and wrong. Or to state the case in psychological
language&mdash;I mean the language of scientific, not of
metaphysical, psychology&mdash;we should have a world in which
morality would have been transmuted into inherited instinct. Now
again let me put the question: can we imagine such a world? Perhaps
you will answer, Yes, in heaven&mdash;nowhere else. But I answer
you that such a world actually exists, and that it can be studied
in almost any part of the East or of Europe by a person of
scientific training. The world of insects actually furnishes
examples of such a moral transformation. It is for this reason that
such writers as Sir John Lubbock and Herbert Spencer have not
hesitated to say that certain kinds of social insects have
immensely surpassed men, both in social and in ethical
progress.</p>
<p>But that is not all that it is necessary to say here. You might
think that I am only repeating a kind of parable. The important
thing is the opinion of scientific men that humanity will at last,
in the course of millions of years, reach the ethical conditions of
the ants. It is only five or six years ago that some of these
conditions were established by scientific evidence, and I want to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name=
"page138">[138]</a></span>speak of them. They have a direct bearing
upon important ethical questions; and they have startled the whole
moral world, and set men thinking in entirely new directions.</p>
<p>In order to explain how the study of social insects has set
moralists of recent years thinking in a new direction, it will be
necessary to generalize a great deal in the course of so short a
lecture. It is especially the social conditions of the ants which
has inspired these new ideas; but you must not think that any one
species of ants furnishes us with all the facts. The facts have
been arrived at only through the study of hundreds of different
kinds of ants by hundreds of scientific men; and it is only by the
consensus of their evidence that we get the ethical picture which I
shall try to outline for you. Altogether there are probably about
five thousand different species of ants, and these different
species represent many different stages of social evolution, from
the most primitive and savage up to the most highly civilized and
moral. The details of the following picture are furnished by a
number of the highest species only; that must not be forgotten.
Also, I must remind you that the morality of the ant, by the
necessity of circumstance, does not extend beyond the limits of its
own species. Impeccably ethical within the community, ants carry on
war outside their own borders; were it not for this, we might call
them morally perfect creatures.</p>
<p>Although the mind of an ant can not be at all <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139">[139]</a></span>like to
the mind of the human being, it is so intelligent that we are
justified in trying to describe its existence by a kind of
allegorical comparison with human life. Imagine, then, a world full
of women, working night and day,&mdash;building, tunnelling,
bridging,&mdash;also engaged in agriculture, in horticulture, and
in taking care of many kinds of domestic animals. (I may remark
that ants have domesticated no fewer than five hundred and
eighty-four different kinds of creatures.) This world of women is
scrupulously clean; busy as they are, all of them carry combs and
brushes about them, and arrange themselves several times a day. In
addition to this constant work, these women have to take care of
myriads of children,&mdash;children so delicate that the slightest
change in the weather may kill them. So the children have to be
carried constantly from one place to another in order to keep them
warm.</p>
<p>Though this multitude of workers are always gathering food, no
one of them would eat or drink a single atom more than is
necessary; and none of them would sleep for one second longer than
is necessary. Now comes a surprising fact, about which a great deal
must be said later on. These women have no sex. They are women, for
they sometimes actually give birth, as virgins, to children; but
they are incapable of wedlock. They are more than vestals. Sex is
practically suppressed.</p>
<p>This world of workers is protected by an army <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140">[140]</a></span>of
soldiers. The soldiers are very large, very strong, and shaped so
differently from the working females that they do not seem at first
to belong to the same race. They help in the work, though they are
not able to help in some delicate kinds of work&mdash;they are too
clumsy and strong. Now comes the second astonishing fact: these
soldiers are all women&mdash;amazons, we might call them; but they
are sexless women. In these also sex has been suppressed.</p>
<p>You ask, where do the children come from? Most of the children
are born of special mothers&mdash;females chosen for the purpose of
bearing offspring, and not allowed to do anything else. They are
treated almost like empresses, being constantly fed and attended
and served, and being lodged in the best way possible. Only these
can eat and drink at all times&mdash;they must do so for the sake
of their offspring. They are not suffered to go out, unless
strongly attended, and they are not allowed to run any risk of
danger or of injury The life of the whole race circles about them
and about their children, but they are very few.</p>
<p>Last of all are the males, the men. One naturally asks why
females should have been specialized into soldiers instead of men.
It appears that the females have more reserve force, and all the
force that might have been utilized in the giving of life has been
diverted to the making of aggressive <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page141" name="page141">[141]</a></span>powers. The real males are
very small and weak. They appear to be treated with indifference
and contempt. They are suffered to become the bridegrooms of one
night, after which they die very quickly. By contrast, the lives of
the rest are very long. Ants live for at least three or four years,
but the males live only long enough to perform their solitary
function.</p>
<p>In the foregoing little fantasy, the one thing that should have
most impressed you is the fact of the suppression of sex. But now
comes the last and most astonishing fact of all: this suppression
of sex is not natural, but artificial&mdash;I mean that it is
voluntary. It has been discovered that ants are able, by a
systematic method of nourishment, to suppress or develop sex as
they please. The race has decided that sex shall not be allowed to
exist except in just so far as it is absolutely necessary to the
existence of the race. Individuals with sex are tolerated only as
necessary evils. Here is an instance of the most powerful of all
passions voluntarily suppressed for the benefit of the community at
large. It vanishes whenever unnecessary; when necessary after a war
or a calamity of some kind, it is called into existence again.
Certainly it is not wonderful that such a fact should have set
moralists thinking. Of course if a human community could discover
some secret way of effecting the same object, and could have the
courage to do it, or rather the unselfishness to do it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name=
"page142">[142]</a></span>the result would simply be that sexual
immorality of any kind would become practically impossible The very
idea of such immorality would cease to exist.</p>
<p>But that is only one fact of self-suppression and the ant-world
furnishes hundreds. To state the whole thing in the simplest
possible way, let me say the race has entirely got rid of
everything that we call a selfish impulse. Even hunger and thirst
allow of no selfish gratification. The entire life of the community
is devoted to the common good and to mutual help and to the care of
the young. Spencer says it is impossible to imagine that an ant has
a sense of duty like our own,&mdash;a religion, if you like. But it
does not need a sense of duty, it does not need religion. Its life
is religion in the practical sense. Probably millions of years ago
the ant had feelings much more like our own than it has now. At
that time, to perform altruistic actions may have been painful to
the ant; to perform them now has become the one pleasure of its
existence. In order to bring up children and serve the state more
efficiently these insects have sacrificed their sex and every
appetite that we call by the name of animal passion. Moreover they
have a perfect community, a society in which nobody could think of
property, except as a state affair, a public thing, or as the
Romans would say a <em>res publica</em>. In a human community so
organized, there could not be ambition, any jealousy, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143">[143]</a></span>any
selfish conduct of any sort&mdash;indeed, no selfishness at all.
The individual is said to be practically sacrificed for the sake of
the race; but such a supposition means the highest moral altruism.
Therefore thinkers have to ask, &ldquo;Will man ever rise to
something like the condition of ants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer says that such is the evident tendency. He does
not say, nor is it at all probable, that there will be in future
humanity such physiological specialization as would correspond to
the suppression of sex among ants, or to the bringing of women to
the dominant place in the human world, and the masculine sex to an
inferior position. That is not likely ever to happen, for reasons
which it would take very much too long to speak of now. But there
is evidence that the most selfish of all human passions will
eventually be brought under control&mdash;under such control that
the present cause of wellnigh all human suffering, the pressure of
population, will be practically removed. And there is psychological
evidence that the human mind will undergo such changes that
wrong-doing, in the sense of unkindly action, will become almost
impossible, and that the highest pleasure will be found not in
selfishness but in unselfishness. Of course there are thousands of
things to think about, suggested by this discovery of the life of
ants. I am only telling the more important ones. What I have told
you ought at least to suggest that the idea of a moral condition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name=
"page144">[144]</a></span>much higher than all our moral conditions
of today is quite possible,&mdash;that it is not an idea to be
laughed at. But it was not Nietzsche who ever conceived this
possibility. His &ldquo;Beyond Man&rdquo; and the real and much to
be hoped for &ldquo;beyond man,&rdquo; are absolutely antagonistic
conceptions. When the ancient Hebrew writer said, thousands of
years ago, &ldquo;Go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her
ways,&rdquo; he could not have imagined how good his advice would
prove in the light of twentieth century science.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_9" name="Ch_9">Chapter IX</a></h3>
<h2>The New Ethics</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of these latter-day intellectual
changes, a word must be said concerning the ethical questions
involved. Of course when a religious faith has been shaken to its
foundation, it is natural to suppose that morals must have been
simultaneously affected. The relation of morals to literature is
very intimate; and we must expect that any change of ideas in the
direction of ethics would show themselves in literature. The drama,
poetry, romance, the novel, all these are reflections of moral
emotion in especial, of the eternal struggle between good and evil,
as well as of the temporary sentiments concerning right and wrong.
And every period of transition is necessarily accompanied by
certain tendencies to disintegration. Contemporary literature in
the West has shown some signs of ethical change. These caused many
thinkers to predict a coming period of demoralization in
literature. But the alarm was really quite needless. These vagaries
of literature, such as books questioning the morality of the
marriage relation, for example, were only repetitions of older
vagaries, and represented <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"
name="page146">[146]</a></span>nothing more than the temporary
agitation of thought upon all questions. The fact seems to be that
in spite of everything, moral feeling was never higher at any time
in Western social history than it is at present. The changes of
thought have indeed been very great, but the moral experience of
mankind remains exactly as valuable as it was before, and new
perceptions of that value have been given to us by the new
philosophy.</p>
<p>It has been wisely observed by the greatest of modern thinkers
that mankind has progressed more rapidly in every other respect
than in morality. Moral progress has not been rapid simply because
the moral ideal has always been kept a little in advance of the
humanly possible. Thousands of years ago the principles of morality
were exactly the same as those which rule our lives to-day. We can
not improve upon them; we can not even improve upon the language
which expressed them. The most learned of our poets could not make
a more beautiful prayer than the prayer which Egyptian mothers
taught to their little children in ages when all Europe was still a
land of savages. The best of the moral philosophy of the nineteenth
century is very little of improvement upon the moral philosophy of
ancient India or China. If there is any improvement at all, it is
simply in the direction of knowledge of causes and effects. And
that is why in all countries <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147"
name="page147">[147]</a></span>the common sense of mankind
universally condemns any attempt to interfere with moral ideas.
These represent the social experience of man for thousands and
thousands of years; and it is not likely that the wisdom of any one
individual can ever better them. If bettered at all it can not be
through theory. The amelioration must be effected by future
experience of a universal kind. We may improve every branch of
science, every branch of art, everything else relating to the work
of human heads and hands; but we can not improve morals by
invention or by hypothesis. Morals are not made, but grow.</p>
<p>Yet, as I have said, there is what may be called a new system of
ethics. But this new system of ethics means nothing more than a new
way of understanding the old system of ethics. By the application
of evolutional science to the study of morals, we have been enabled
to trace back the whole history of moral ideas to the time of their
earliest inception,&mdash;to understand the reasons of them, and to
explain them without the help of any supernatural theory. And the
result, so far from diminishing our respect for the wisdom of our
ancestors, has immensely increased that respect. There is no single
moral teaching common to different civilizations and different
religions of an advanced stage of development which we do not find
to be eternally true. Let us try to study this view of the case by
the help of a few examples.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name=
"page148">[148]</a></span>In early times, of course, men obeyed
moral instruction through religious motives. If asked why they
thought it was wrong to perform certain actions and right to
perform others, they could have answered only that such was
ancestral custom and that the gods will it so. Not until we could
understand the laws governing the evolution of society could we
understand the reason of many ethical regulations. But now we can
understand very plainly that the will of the gods, as our ancestors
might have termed it, represents divine laws indeed, for the laws
of ethical evolution are certainly the unknown laws shaping all
things&mdash;suns, worlds, and human societies. All that opposes
itself to the operation of those universal laws is what we have
been accustomed to call bad, and everything which aids the
operation of those laws is what we have been accustomed to think of
as good. The common crimes condemned by all religions, such as
theft, murder, adultery, bearing false witness, disloyalty, all
these are practices which directly interfere with the natural
process of evolution; and without understanding why, men have from
the earliest times of real civilisation united all their power to
suppress them. I think that we need not dwell upon the simple
facts; they will at once suggest to you all that is necessary to
know. I shall select for illustration only one less familiar topic,
that of the ascetic ideal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name=
"page149">[149]</a></span>A great many things which in times of
lesser knowledge we imagined to be superstitious or useless, prove
to-day on examination to have been of immense value to mankind.
Probably no superstition ever existed which did not have some
social value; and the most seemingly repulsive or cruel sometimes
turn out to have been the most precious. To choose one of these for
illustration, we must take one not confined to any particular
civilization or religion, but common to all human societies at a
certain period of their existence; and the ascetic ideal best fits
our purpose. From very early times, even from a time long preceding
any civilization, we find men acting under the idea that by
depriving themselves of certain pleasures and by subjecting
themselves to certain pains they could please the divine powers and
thereby obtain strength. Probably there is no people in the world
among whom this belief has not had at some one time or another a
very great influence. At a later time, in the early civilizations,
this idea would seem to have obtained much larger sway, and to have
affected national life more and more extensively. In the age of the
great religions the idea reaches its acme, an acme often
represented by extravagances of the most painful kind and
sacrifices which strike modern imagination as ferocious and
terrible. In Europe asceticism reached its great extremes as you
know during the Middle Ages, and especially took the direction of
antagonism <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name=
"page150">[150]</a></span>to the natural sex-relation. Looking back
to-day to the centuries in which celibacy was considered the most
moral condition, and marriage was counted as little better than
weakness, when Europe was covered with thousands of monasteries,
and when the best intellects of the age deemed it the highest duty
to sacrifice everything pleasurable for the sake of an imaginary
reward after death, we can not but recognize that we are
contemplating a period of religious insanity. Even in the
architecture of the time, the architecture that Ruskin devoted his
splendid talent to praise, there is a grim and terrible something
that suggests madness. Again, the cruelties of the age have an
insane character, the burning alive of myriads of people who
refused to believe or could not believe in the faith of their time;
the tortures used to extort confessions from the innocent; the
immolation of thousands charged with being wizards or witches; the
extinction of little centres of civilization in the South of France
and elsewhere by brutal crusades&mdash;contemplating all this, we
seem to be contemplating not only madness but furious madness. I
need not speak to you of the Crusades, which also belonged to this
period. Compared with the Roman and Greek civilizations before it,
what a horrible Europe it was! And yet the thinker must recognize
that it had a strength of its own, a strength of a larger kind than
that of the preceding civilizations. It may seem monstrous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name=
"page151">[151]</a></span>to assert that all this cruelty and
superstition and contempt of learning were absolutely necessary for
the progress of mankind; and yet we must so accept them in the
light of modern knowledge. The checking of intellectual development
for hundreds of years is certainly a fact that must shock us; but
the true question is whether such a checking had not become
necessary. Intellectual strength, unless supported by moral
strength, leads a people into the ways of destruction. Compared
with the men of the Middle Ages, the Greeks and Romans were
incomparably superior intellectually; compared with them morally
they were very weak. They had conquered the world and developed all
the arts, these Greeks and Romans; they had achieved things such as
mankind has never since been able to accomplish, and then, losing
their moral ideal, losing their simplicity, losing their faith,
they were utterly crushed by inferior races in whom the principles
of self-denial had been intensely developed. And the old
instinctive hatred of the Church for the arts and the letters and
the sciences of the Greek and Roman civilizations was not quite so
much of a folly as we might be apt to suppose. The priests
recognized in a vague way that anything like a revival of the older
civilizations would signify moral ruin. The Renaissance proves that
the priests were not wrong. Had the movement occurred a few hundred
years earlier, the result <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152"
name="page152">[152]</a></span>would probably have been a universal
corruption I do not mean to say that the Church at any time was
exactly conscious of what she was doing; she acted blindly under
the influence of an instinctive fear. But the result of all that
she did has now proved unfortunate. What the Roman and Greek
civilizations had lost in moral power was given back to the world
by the frightful discipline of the Middle Ages. For a long series
of generations the ascetic idea was triumphant; and it became
feeble only in proportion as men became strong enough to do without
it. Especially it remodelled that of which it first seemed the
enemy, the family relation. It created a new basis for society,
founded upon a new sense of the importance to society of family
morals. Because this idea, this morality, came through
superstition, its value is not thereby in the least diminished.
Superstitions often represent correct guesses at eternal truth.
To-day we know that all social progress, all national strength, all
national vigour, intellectual as well as physical, depend
essentially upon the family, upon the morality of the household,
upon the relation of parents to children. It was this fact which
the Greeks and Romans forgot, and lost themselves by forgetting. It
was this fact which the superstitious tyranny of the Middle Ages
had to teach the West over again, and after such a fashion that it
is not likely ever to become forgotten. So much for the mental
history of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name=
"page153">[153]</a></span>question. Let us say a word about the
physical aspects of it.</p>
<p>No doubt you have read that the result of macerating the body,
of depriving oneself of all comfort, and even of nourishing food,
is not an increase of intellectual vigour or moral power of any
kind. And in one sense this is true. The individual who passes his
life in self-mortification is not apt to improve under that regime.
For this reason the founder of the greatest of Oriental religions
condemned asceticism on the part of his followers, except within
certain fixed limits. But the history of the changes produced by a
universal idea is not a history of changes in the individual, but
of changes brought about by the successive efforts of millions of
individuals in the course of many generations. Not in one lifetime
can we perceive the measure of ethical force obtained by
self-control; but in the course of several hundreds of years we
find that the result obtained is so large as to astonish us. This
result, imperceptibly obtained, signifies a great increase of that
nervous power upon which moral power depends; it means an
augmentation in strength of every kind; and this augmentation again
represents what we might call economy. Just as there is a science
of political economy, there is a science of ethical economy; and it
is in relation to such a science that we should rationally consider
the influence of all religions teaching self-suppression. So
studying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name=
"page154">[154]</a></span>we find that self-suppression does not
mean the destruction of any power, but only the economical storage
of that power for the benefit of the race As a result, the highly
civilized man can endure incomparably more than the savage, whether
of moral or physical strain. Being better able to control himself
under all circumstances, he has a great advantage over the
savage.</p>
<p>That which is going on in the new teaching of ethics is really
the substitution of a rational for an emotional morality. But this
does not mean that the value of the emotional element in morality
is not recognized. Not only is it recognized, but it is even being
enlarged&mdash;enlarged, however, in a rational way. For example,
let us take the very emotional virtue of loyalty. Loyalty, in a
rational form, could not exist among an uneducated people; it could
only exist as a feeling, a sentiment. In the primitive state of
society this sentiment takes the force and the depth of a religion.
And the ruler, regarded as divine, really has in relation to his
people the power of a god. Once that people becomes educated in the
modern sense, their ideas regarding their ruler and their duties to
their ruler necessarily undergo modification. But does this mean
that the sentiment is weakened in the educated class? I should say
that this depends very much upon the quality of the individual
mind. In a mind of small capacity, incapable of receiving the
higher forms of thought, it is very <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page155" name="page155">[155]</a></span>likely that the sentiment
may be weakened and almost destroyed. But in the mind of a real
thinker, a man of true culture, the sense of loyalty, although
changed, is at the same time immensely expanded. In order to give a
strong example, I should take the example not from a monarchical
country but from a republican one. What does the President of the
United States of America, for example, represent to the American of
the highest culture? He appears to him in two entirely different
capacities. First he appears to him merely as a man, an ordinary
man, with faults and weaknesses like other ordinary men. His
private life is apt to be discussed in the newspapers. He is
expected to shake hands with anybody and with everybody whom he
meets at Washington; and when he ceases to hold office, he has no
longer any particular distinction from other Americans. But as the
President of the United States, he is also much more than a man. He
represents one hundred millions of people; he represents the
American Constitution; he represents the great principles of human
freedom laid down by that Constitution; he represents also the idea
of America, of everything American, of all the hopes, interests,
and glories of the nation. Officially he is quite as sacred as a
divinity could be. Millions would give their lives for him at an
instant&rsquo;s notice; and thousands capable of making vulgar
jokes about the man would hotly resent the least <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156">[156]</a></span>word
spoken about the President as the representative of America. The
very same thing exists in other Western countries, notwithstanding
the fact that the lives of rulers are sometimes attempted. England
is a striking example. The Queen has really scarcely any power; her
rule is little more than nominal. Every Englishman knows that
England is a monarchy only in name. But the Queen represents to
every Englishman more than a woman and more than a queen: she
represents England, English race feeling, English love of country,
English power, English dignity; she is a symbol, and as a symbol
sacred. The soldier jokingly calls her &ldquo;the Widow&rdquo;; he
makes songs about her; all this is well and good. But a soldier who
cursed her a few years ago was promptly sent to prison for twenty
years. To sing a merry song about the sovereign as a woman is a
right which English freedom claims; but to speak disrespectfully of
the Queen, as England, as the government, is properly regarded as a
crime; because it proves the man capable of it indifferent to all
his duties as an Englishman, as a citizen, as a soldier. The spirit
of loyalty is far from being lost in Western countries; it has only
changed in character, and it is likely to strengthen as time goes
on.</p>
<p>Broad tolerance in the matter of beliefs is necessarily a part
of the new ethics. It is quite impossible in the present state of
mankind that all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name=
"page157">[157]</a></span>persons should be well educated, or that
the great masses of a nation should attain to the higher forms of
culture. For the uneducated a rational system of ethics must long
remain out of the question and it is proper that they should cling
to the old emotional forms of moral teaching. The observation of
Huxley that he would like to see every unbeliever who could not get
a reason for his unbelief publicly put to shame, was an observation
of sound common sense. It is only those whose knowledge obliges
them to see things from another standpoint than that of the masses
who can safely claim to base their rule of life upon philosophical
morality. The value of the philosophical morality happens to be
only in those directions where it recognizes and supports the truth
taught by common morality, which, after all, is the safest guide.
Therefore the philosophical moralist will never mock or oppose a
belief which he knows to exercise a good influence upon human
conduct. He will recognize even the value of many superstitions as
being very great; and he will understand that any attempt to
suddenly change the beliefs of man in any ethical direction must be
mischievous. Such changes as he might desire will come; but they
should come gradually and gently, in exact proportion to the
expanding capacity of the national mind. Recognizing this
probability, several Western countries, notably America, have
attempted to introduce into education an entirely new system
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name=
"page158">[158]</a></span>of ethical teaching&mdash;ethical
teaching in the broadest sense, and in harmony with the new
philosophy. But the result there and elsewhere can only be that
which I have said at the beginning of this lecture,&mdash;namely,
the enlargement of the old moral ideas, and the deeper
comprehension of their value in all relations of life.</p>

<h2>Some Poems about Insects</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>One of the great defects of English books printed in the last
century is the want of an index. The importance of being able to
refer at once to any subject treated of in a book was not
recognized until the days when exact scholarship necessitated
indexing of the most elaborate kind. But even now we constantly
find good books severely criticized because of this deficiency. All
that I have said tends to show that even to-day in Western
countries the immense importance of systematic arrangement in
literary collections is not sufficiently recognized. We have, of
course, a great many English anthologies,&mdash;that is to say,
collections of the best typical compositions of a certain epoch in
poetry or in prose. But you must have observed that, in Western
countries, nearly all such anthologies are compiled
chronologically&mdash;not according to the subject of the poems. To
this general rule there are indeed a few exceptions. There is a
collection of love poetry by Watson, which is famous; a collection
of child poetry by Patmore; a collection of &ldquo;society
verse&rdquo; by Locker-Lampson; and several things of that sort.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name=
"page160">[160]</a></span>But even here the arrangement is not of a
special kind; nor is it ever divided according to the subject of
each particular poem. I know that some books have been published of
late years with such titles as &ldquo;Poems of the Sea,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Poems of Nature&rdquo;&mdash;but these are of no literary
importance at all and they are not compiled by competent critics.
Besides, the subject-heads are always of much too general a kind.
The French are far in advance of the English in the art of making
anthologies; but even in such splendid anthologies as those of
Cr&eacute;pet and of Lemerre the arrangement is of the most general
kind,&mdash;chronological, and little more.</p>
<p>I was reminded to tell you this, because of several questions
recently asked me, which I found it impossible to answer. Many a
Japanese student might suppose that Western poetry has its
classified arrangements corresponding in some sort to those of
Japanese poetry. Perhaps the Germans have something of the kind,
but the English and French have not. Any authority upon the subject
of Japanese literature can, I have been told, inform himself almost
immediately as to all that has been written in poetry upon a
particular subject. Japanese poetry has been classified and
sub-classified and double-indexed or even quadruple-indexed after a
manner incomparably more exact than anything English anthologies
can show. I am aware that this fact is chiefly owing to the ancient
rules <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name=
"page161">[161]</a></span>about subjects, seasons, contrasts, and
harmonies, after which the old poets used to write. But whatever be
said about such rules, there can be no doubt at all of the
excellence of the arrangements which the rules produced. It is
greatly to be regretted that we have not in English a system of
arrangement enabling the student to discover quickly all that has
been written upon a particular subject&mdash;such as roses, for
example, or pine trees, or doves, or the beauties of the autumn
season. There is nobody to tell you where to find such things; and
as the whole range of English poetry is so great that it takes a
great many years even to glance through it, a memorized knowledge
of the subjects is impossible for the average man. I believe that
Macaulay would have been able to remember almost any reference in
the poetry then accessible to scholars,&mdash;just as the wonderful
Greek scholar Porson could remember the exact place of any text in
the whole of Greek literature, and even all the variations of that
text. But such men are born only once in hundreds of years; the
common memory can not attempt to emulate their feats. And it is
very difficult at the present time for the ordinary student of
poetry to tell you just how much has been written upon any
particular subject by the best English poets.</p>
<p>Now you will recognize some difficulties in the way of a
lecturer in attempting to make classifications of English poetry
after the same manner <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name=
"page162">[162]</a></span>that Japanese classification can be made
of Japanese poetry. One must read enormously merely to obtain
one&rsquo;s materials, and even then the result is not to be
thought of as exhaustive. I am going to try to give you a few
lectures upon English poetry thus classified, but we must not
expect that the lectures will be authoritatively complete. Indeed,
we have no time for lectures of so thorough a sort. All that I can
attempt will be to give you an idea of the best things that English
poets have thought and expressed upon certain subjects.</p>
<p>You know that the old Greeks wrote a great deal of beautiful
poetry about insects,&mdash;especially about musical insects,
crickets, cicadas, and other insects such as those the Japanese
poets have been writing about for so many hundreds of years. But in
modern Western poetry there is very little, comparatively speaking,
about insects. The English poets have all written a great deal
about birds, and especially about singing birds; but very little
has been written upon the subject of insects&mdash;singing insects.
One reason is probably that the number of musical insects in
England is very small, perhaps owing to the climate. American poets
have written more about insects than English poets have done,
though their work is of a much less finished kind. But this is
because musical insects in America are very numerous. On the whole,
we may say that neither in English nor in French poetry will you
find much about the Voices of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163"
name="page163">[163]</a></span>rickets, locusts, or cicad&aelig;. I
could not even give you a special lecture upon that subject. We
must take the subject &ldquo;insect&rdquo; in a rather general
signification; and if we do that we can edit together a nice little
collection of poetical examples.</p>
<p>The butterfly was regarded by the Greeks especially as the
emblem of the soul and therefore of immortality. We have several
Greek remains, picturing the butterfly as perched upon a skull,
thus symbolizing life beyond death. And the metamorphosis of the
insect is, you know, very often referred to in Greek philosophy. We
might expect that English poets would have considered the butterfly
especially from this point of view; and we do have a few examples.
Perhaps the best known is that of Coleridge.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">The butterfly the ancient Grecians made</p>
<p>The soul&rsquo;s fair emblem, and its only name&mdash;</p>
<p>But of the soul, escaped the slavish trade</p>
<p>Of earthly life! For in this mortal frame</p>
<p>Ours is the reptile&rsquo;s lot, much toil, much blame,</p>
<p>Manifold motions making little speed,</p>
<p>And to deform and kill the things whereon we feed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The allusion to the &ldquo;name&rdquo; is of course to the Greek
word, <em>psyche</em>, which signifies both soul and butterfly.
Psyche, as the soul, was pictured by the Greeks as a beautiful
girl, with a somewhat sad face, and butterfly wings springing from
her shoulders. Coleridge tells us here that although the Greeks
likened the soul to the butterfly, we <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page164" name="page164">[164]</a></span>must remember what the
butterfly really is,&mdash;the last and highest state of
insect-being&mdash;&ldquo;escaped the slavish trade of earthly
life.&rdquo; What is this so-called slavish trade? It is the
necessity of working and struggling in order to live&mdash;in order
to obtain food. The butterfly is not much of an eater; some
varieties, indeed, do not eat at all. All the necessity for eating
ended with the life of the larva. In the same manner religion
teaches that the soul represents the changed state of man. In this
life a man is only like a caterpillar; death changes him into a
chrysalis, and out of the chrysalis issues the winged soul which
does not have to trouble itself about such matters as eating and
drinking. By the word &ldquo;reptile&rdquo; in this verse, you must
understand caterpillar. Therefore the poet speaks of all our human
work as manifold motions making little speed; you have seen how
many motions a caterpillar must make in order to go even a little
distance, and you must have noticed the manner in which it spoils
the appearance of the plant upon which it feeds. There is here an
allusion to the strange and terrible fact, that all life&mdash;and
particularly the life of man&mdash;is maintained only by the
destruction of other life. In order to live we must
kill&mdash;perhaps only plants, but in any case we must kill.</p>
<p>Wordsworth has several poems on butterflies, but only one of
them is really fine. It is fine, not because it suggests any deep
problem, but because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name=
"page165">[165]</a></span>with absolute simplicity it pictures the
charming difference of character in a little boy and a little girl
playing together in the fields. The poem is addressed to the
butterfly.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Stay near me&mdash;do not take thy flight!</p>
<p>A little longer stay in sight!</p>
<p>Much converse do I find in thee,</p>
<p>Historian of my infancy!</p>

<p>Dead times revive in thee:</p>
<p>Thou bring&rsquo;st, gay creature as thou art!</p>
<p>A solemn image to my heart,</p>
<p class="i2">My father&rsquo;s family.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! pleasant, pleasant were the days,</p>
<p>The time, when, in our childish plays,</p>
<p>My sister Emmeline and I</p>
<p>Together chased the butterfly!</p>
<p>A very hunter did I rush</p>
<p>Upon the prey: with leaps and springs</p>
<p>I followed on from brake to bush;</p>
<p>But she, God love her, feared to brush</p>
<p>The dust from off its wings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What we call and what looks like dust on the wings of a
butterfly, English children are now taught to know as really
beautiful scales or featherlets, but in Wordsworth&rsquo;s time the
real structure of the insect was not so well known as now to little
people. Therefore to the boy the coloured matter brushed from the
wings would only have seemed so much dust. But the little girl,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name=
"page166">[166]</a></span>with the instinctive tenderness of the
future mother-soul in her, dreads to touch those strangely delicate
wings; she fears, not only to spoil, but also to hurt.</p>
<p>Deeper thoughts than memory may still be suggested to English
poets by the sight of a butterfly, and probably will be for
hundreds of years to come. Perhaps the best poem of a
half-metaphorical, half-philosophical thought about butterflies is
the beautiful prologue to Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fifine at the
Fair,&rdquo; which prologue is curiously entitled
&ldquo;Amphibian&rdquo;&mdash;implying that we are about to have a
reference to creatures capable of living in two distinctive
elements, yet absolutely belonging neither to the one nor to the
other. The poet swims out far into the sea on a beautiful day; and,
suddenly, looking up, perceives a beautiful butterfly flying over
his head, as if watching him. The sight of the insect at once
suggests to him its relation to Greek fancy as a name for the soul;
then he begins to wonder whether it might not really be the soul,
or be the symbol of the soul, of a dead woman who loved him. From
that point of the poem begins a little metaphysical fantasy about
the possible condition of souls.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The fancy I had to-day,</p>
<p>Fancy which turned a fear!</p>
<p>I swam far out in the bay,</p>
<p>Since waves laughed warm and clear.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name=
"page167">[167]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I lay and looked at the sun,</p>
<p>The noon-sun looked at me:</p>
<p>Between us two, no one</p>
<p>Live creature, that I could see.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yes! There came floating by</p>
<p>Me, who lay floating too,</p>
<p>Such a strange butterfly!</p>
<p>Creature as dear as new:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Because the membraned wings</p>
<p>So wonderful, so wide,</p>
<p>So sun-suffused, were things</p>
<p>Like soul and nought beside.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So much for the conditions of the poet&rsquo;s revery. He is
swimming in the sea; above his face, only a few inches away, the
beautiful butterfly is hovering. Its apparition makes him think of
many things&mdash;perhaps first about the dangerous position of the
butterfly, for if it should only touch the water, it is certain to
be drowned. But it does not touch the water; and he begins to think
how clumsy is the man who moves in water compared with the insect
that moves in air, and how ugly a man is by comparison with the
exquisite creature which the Greeks likened to the soul or ghost of
the man. Thinking about ghosts leads him at once to the memory of a
certain very dear ghost about which he forthwith begins to
dream.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>What if a certain soul</p>
<p>Which early slipped its sheath,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name=
"page168">[168]</a></span>
<p>And has for its home the whole</p>
<p>Of heaven, thus look beneath,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thus watch one who, in the world,</p>
<p>Both lives and likes life&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>Nor wishes the wings unfurled</p>
<p>That sleep in the worm, they say?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But sometimes when the weather</p>
<p>Is blue, and warm waves tempt</p>
<p>To free oneself of tether,</p>
<p>And try a life exempt</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>From worldly noise and dust,</p>
<p>In the sphere which overbrims</p>
<p>With passion and thought,&mdash;why, just</p>
<p>Unable to fly, one swims!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is better understood by paraphrase: &ldquo;I wonder if the
soul of a certain person, who lately died, slipped so gently out of
the hard sheath of the perishable body&mdash;I wonder if she does
not look down from her home in the sky upon me, just as that little
butterfly is doing at this moment. And I wonder if she laughs at
the clumsiness of this poor swimmer, who finds it so much labour
even to move through the water, while she can move through whatever
she pleases by the simple act of wishing. And this man, strangely
enough, does not want to die, and to become a ghost. He likes to
live very much; he does not yet desire those soul-wings which are
supposed to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name=
"page169">[169]</a></span>be growing within the shell of his body,
just as the wings of the butterfly begin to grow in the chrysalis.
He does not want to die at all. But sometimes he wants to get away
from the struggle and the dust of the city, and to be alone with
nature; and then, in order to be perfectly alone, he swims. He
would like to fly much better; but he can not. However, swimming is
very much like flying, only the element of water is thicker than
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, more than the poet&rsquo;s words is suggested here. We
are really told that what a fine mind desires is spiritual life,
pure intellectual life&mdash;free from all the trammels of bodily
necessity. Is not the swimmer really a symbol of the superior mind
in its present condition? Your best swimmer can not live under the
water, neither can he rise into the beautiful blue air. He can only
keep his head in the air; his body must remain in the grosser
element. Well, a great thinker and poet is ever thus&mdash;floating
between the universe of spirit and the universe of matter. By his
mind he belongs to the region of pure mind,&mdash;the ethereal
state; but the hard necessity of living keeps him down in the world
of sense and grossness and struggle. On the other hand the
butterfly, freely moving in a finer element, better represents the
state of spirit or soul.</p>
<p>What is the use of being dissatisfied with nature? The best we
can do is to enjoy in the imagination <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page170" name="page170">[170]</a></span>those things which it is
not possible for us to enjoy in fact.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Emancipate through passion</p>
<p>And thought, with sea for sky,</p>
<p>We substitute, in a fashion,</p>
<p>For heaven&mdash;poetry:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Which sea, to all intent,</p>
<p>Gives flesh such noon-disport,</p>
<p>As a finer element</p>
<p>Affords the spirit-sort.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now you see where the poet&rsquo;s vision of a beautiful
butterfly has been leading his imagination. The nearest approach
which we can make to the act of flying, in the body, is the act of
swimming. The nearest approach that we can make to the heavenly
condition, mentally, is in poetry. Poetry, imagination, the
pleasure of emotional expression&mdash;these represent our nearest
approach to paradise. Poetry is the sea in which the soul of man
can swim even as butterflies can swim in the air, or happy ghosts
swim in the finer element of the infinite ether. The last three
stanzas of the poem are very suggestive:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And meantime, yonder streak</p>
<p>Meets the horizon&rsquo;s verge;</p>
<p>That is the land, to seek</p>
<p>If we tire or dread the surge:</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name=
"page171">[171]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Land the solid and safe&mdash;</p>
<p>To welcome again (confess!)</p>
<p>When, high and dry, we chafe</p>
<p>The body, and don the dress.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Does she look, pity, wonder</p>
<p>At one who mimics flight,</p>
<p>Swims&mdash;heaven above, sea under,</p>
<p>Yet always earth in sight?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Streak,&rdquo; meaning an indistinct line, here refers to
the coast far away, as it appears to the swimmer. It is just such a
word as a good Japanese painter ought to appreciate in such a
relation. In suggesting that the swimmer is glad to return to shore
again and get warm, the poet is telling us that however much we may
talk about the happiness of spirits in heaven&mdash;however much we
may praise heaven in poetry&mdash;the truth is that we are very
fond of this world, we like comfort, we like company, we like human
love and human pleasures. There is a good deal of nonsense in
pretending that we think heaven is a better place than the world to
which we belong. Perhaps it is a better place, but, as a matter of
fact, we do not know anything about it; and we should be frightened
if we could go beyond a certain distance from the real world which
we do know. As he tells us this, the poet begins again to think
about the spirit of the dead woman. Is she happy? Is she looking at
him&mdash;and pitying him as he <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page172" name="page172">[172]</a></span>swims, taking good care
not to go too far away from the land? Or is she laughing at him,
because in his secret thoughts he confesses that he likes to
live&mdash;that he does not want to become a pure ghost at the
present time?</p>
<p>Evidently a butterfly was quite enough, not only to make
Browning&rsquo;s mind think very seriously, but to make that mind
teach us the truth and seriousness which may attach to very small
things&mdash;incidents, happenings of daily life, in any hour and
place. I believe that is the greatest English poem we have on the
subject of the butterfly.</p>
<p>The idea that a butterfly might be, not merely the symbol of the
soul, but in very fact the spirit of a dead person, is somewhat
foreign to English thought; and whatever exists in poetry on the
subject must necessarily be quite new. The idea of a relation
between insects, birds, or other living creatures, and the spirits
of the dead, is enormously old in Oriental literature;&mdash;we
find it in Sanskrit texts thousands of years ago. But the Western
mind has not been accustomed to think of spiritual life as outside
of man; and much of natural poetry has consequently remained
undeveloped in Western countries. A strange little poem, &ldquo;The
White Moth,&rdquo; is an exception to the general rule that I have
indicated; but I am almost certain that its author, A.T.
Quiller-Couch, must have read Oriental books, or obtained his fancy
from some Eastern source. As the knowledge of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173">[173]</a></span>Indian
literature becomes more general in England, we may expect to find
poetry much influenced by Oriental ideas. At the present time, such
a composition as this is quite a strange anomaly.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><em>If a leaf rustled, she would start:</em></p>
<p><em>And yet she died, a year ago.</em></p>
<p><em>How had so frail a thing the heart</em></p>
<p><em>To journey where she trembled so?</em></p>
<p><em>And do they turn and turn in fright,</em></p>
<p><em>Those little feet, in so much night?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The light above the poet&rsquo;s head</p>

<p>And twice and thrice there buffeted</p>
<p>On the black pane a white-winged moth:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas Annie&rsquo;s soul that beat outside,</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Open, open, open!&rdquo; cried:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;I could not find the way to God;</p>
<p>There were too many flaming suns</p>
<p>For signposts, and the fearful road</p>
<p>Led over wastes where millions</p>

<p>I was bewildered and I turned.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was easy then! I knew</p>
<p>Your window and no star beside.</p>
<p>Look up and take me back to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;He rose and thrust the window wide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas but because his brain was hot</p>
<p>With rhyming; for he heard her not.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name=
"page174">[174]</a></span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But poets polishing a phrase</p>
<p>Show anger over trivial things;</p>
<p>And as she blundered in the blaze</p>
<p>Towards him, on ecstatic wings,</p>
<p>He raised a hand and smote her dead;</p>
<p>Then wrote &ldquo;<em>That I had died instead!</em>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The lover, or bereaved husband, is writing a poem of which a
part is given in the first stanza&mdash;which is therefore put in
italics. The action proper begins with the second stanza. The soul
of the dead woman taps at the window in the shape of a
night-butterfly or moth&mdash;imagining, perhaps, that she has
still a voice and can make herself heard by the man that she loves.
She tells the story of her wandering in space&mdash;privileged to
pass to heaven, yet afraid of the journey. Now the subject of the
poem which the lover happens to be writing inside the room is a
memory of the dead woman&mdash;mourning for her, describing her in
exquisite ways. He can not hear her at all; he does not hear even
the beating of the little wings at the window, but he stands up and
opens the window&mdash;because he happens to feel hot and tired.
The moth thinks that he has heard her, that he knows; and she flies
toward him in great delight. But he, thinking that it is only a
troublesome insect, kills her with a blow of his hand; and then
sits down to continue his poem with the words, &ldquo;Oh, how I
wish I could have died instead <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page175" name="page175">[175]</a></span>of that dear woman!&rdquo;
Altogether this is a queer poem in English literature, and I
believe almost alone of its kind. But it is queer only because of
its rarity of subject. As for construction, it is very good
indeed.</p>
<p>I do not know that it is necessary to quote any more poems upon
butterflies or moths. There are several others; but the workmanship
and the thought are not good enough or original enough to justify
their use here as class texts. So I shall now turn to the subject
of dragon-flies. Here we must again be very brief. References to
dragon-flies are common throughout English poetry, but the
references signify little more than a mere colourless mention of
the passing of the insect. However, it so happens that the finest
modern lines of pure description written about any insect, are
about dragon-flies. And they also happen to be by Tennyson.
Naturalists and men of science have greatly praised these lines,
because of their truth to nature and the accuracy of observation
which they show. You will find them in the poem entitled &ldquo;The
Two Voices.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>To-day I saw the dragon-fly</p>
<p>Come from the wells where he did lie.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>An inner impulse rent the veil</p>
<p>Of his old husk; from head to tail</p>
<p>Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name=

<div class="stanza">
<p>He dried his wings; like gauze they grew;</p>
<p>Thro&rsquo; crofts and pastures wet with dew</p>
<p>A living rush of light he flew.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are very few real poems, however, upon the dragon-fly in
English, and considering the extraordinary beauty and grace of the
insect, this may appear strange to you. But I think that you can
explain the strangeness at a later time. The silence of English
poets on the subject of insects as compared with Japanese poets is
due to general causes that we shall consider at the close of the
lecture.</p>
<p>Common flies could scarcely seem to be a subject for
poetry&mdash;disgusting and annoying creatures as they are. But
there are more poems about the house-fly than about the dragon-fly.
Last year I quoted for you a remarkable and rather mystical
composition by the poet Blake about accidentally killing a fly.
Blake represents his own thoughts about the brevity of human life
which had been aroused by the incident. It is charming little poem;
but it does not describe the fly at all. I shall not quote it here
again, because we shall have many other things to talk about; but I
shall give you the text of a famous little composition by Oldys on
the same topic. It has almost the simplicity of Blake,&mdash;and
certainly something of the same kind of philosophy.</p>
<div class="poem">

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name=

<p>Freely welcome to my cup,</p>
<p>Couldst thou sip and sip it up:</p>
<p>Make the most of life you may,</p>
<p>Life is short and wears away.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Both alike are mine and thine</p>
<p>Hastening quick to their decline:</p>
<p>Thine&rsquo;s a summer, mine&rsquo;s no more,</p>
<p>Though repeated to threescore.</p>
<p>Threescore summers, when they&rsquo;re gone,</p>
<p>Will appear as short as one!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The suggestion is that, after all, time is only a very relative
affair in the cosmic order of things. The life of the man of sixty
years is not much longer than the life of the insect which lives
but a few hours, days, or months. Had Oldys, who belongs to the
eighteenth century, lived in our own time, he might have been able
to write something very much more curious on this subject. It is
now known that time, to the mind of an insect, must appear
immensely longer than it appears to the mind of a man. It has been
calculated that a mosquito or a gnat moves its wings between four
and five hundred times a second. Now the scientific dissection of
such an insect, under the microscope, justifies the opinion that
the insect must be conscious of each beat of the wings&mdash;just
as a man feels that he lifts his arm or bends his head every time
that the action is performed. A man can not even imagine the
consciousness of so short an interval of time as the five-hundredth
part of one <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name=
"page178">[178]</a></span>second. But insect consciousness can be
aware of such intervals; and a single day of life might well appear
to the gnat as long as the period of a month to a man. Indeed, we
have reason to suppose that to even the shortest-lived insect life
does not appear short at all; and that the ephemeral may actually,
so far as felling is concerned, live as long as a
man&mdash;although its birth and death does occur between the
rising and the setting of the sun.</p>
<p>We might suppose that bees would form a favourite subject of
poetry, especially in countries where agriculture is practised upon
such a scale as in England. But such is not really the case. Nearly
every English poet makes some reference to bees, as Tennyson does
in the famous couplet&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The moan of doves in immemorial elms,</p>
<p>And murmuring of innumerable bees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But the only really remarkable poem addressed to a bee is by the
American philosopher Emerson. The poem in question can not be
compared as to mere workmanship with some others which I have
cited; but as to thinking, it is very interesting, and you must
remember that the philosopher who writes poetry should be judged
for his thought rather than for the measure of his verse. The whole
is not equally good, nor is it short enough to quote entire; I
shall only give the best parts.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name=
"page180">[180]</a></span>This is really the poetry of the
bee&mdash;visiting only beautiful flowers, and sucking from them
their perfumed juices&mdash;always healthy, happy, and surrounded
by beautiful things. A great rover, a constant wanderer is the
bee&mdash;visiting many different places, seeing many different
things, but stopping only to enjoy what is beautiful to the sight
and sweet to the taste. Now Emerson tells us that a wise man should
act like the bee&mdash;never stopping to look at what is bad, or
what is morally ugly, but seeking only what is beautiful and
nourishing for the mind. It is a very fine thought; and the manner
of expressing it is greatly helped by Emerson&rsquo;s use of
curious and forcible words&mdash;such as &ldquo;burly,&rdquo;
&ldquo;zigzag,&rdquo; and the famous expression
&ldquo;yellow-breeched philosopher&rdquo;&mdash;which has passed
almost into an American household phrase. The allusion of course is
to the thighs of the bee, covered with the yellow pollen of flowers
so as to make them seem covered with yellow breeches, or trousers
reaching only to the knees.</p>
<p>I do not of course include in the lecture such child songs about
insects as that famous one beginning with the words, &ldquo;How
doth the little busy bee improve each shining hour.&rdquo; This is
no doubt didactically very good; but I wish to offer you only
examples of really fine poetry on the topic. Therefore leaving the
subject of bees for the time, let us turn to the subject of musical
insects<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name=
"page181">[181]</a></span>&mdash;the singers of the fields and
woods&mdash;grasshoppers and crickets.</p>
<p>In Japanese poetry there are thousands of verses upon such
insects. Therefore it seems very strange that we have scarcely
anything on the subject in English. And the little that we do have
is best represented by the poem of Keats on the night cricket. The
reference is probably to what we call in England the hearth
cricket, an insect which hides in houses, making itself at home in
some chink of the brickwork or stonework about a fireplace, for it
loves the warmth. I suppose that the small number of poems in
English about crickets can be partly explained by the scarcity of
night singers. Only the house cricket seems to be very well known.
But on the other hand, we can not so well explain the rarity of
composition in regard to the day-singers&mdash;the grasshoppers and
locusts which can be heard, though somewhat faintly, in any English
country place after sunset during the warm season. Another queer
thing is that the example set by Keats has not been imitated or at
least followed even up to the present time.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The poetry of earth is never dead:</p>
<p>When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this charming composition you will have noticed the word
&ldquo;stove&rdquo;; but you must remember that this is not a stove
as we understand the term now, and signifies only an old-fashioned
fireplace <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name=
"page182">[182]</a></span>of brick or tile. In Keats&rsquo;s day
there were no iron stoves. Another word which I want to notice is
the word &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; in the first line. By the poetry of
nature the poet means the voices of nature&mdash;the musical sounds
made by its idle life in woods and fields. So the word
&ldquo;poetry&rdquo; here has especially the meaning of song, and
corresponds very closely to the Japanese word which signifies
either poem or song, but perhaps more especially the latter. The
general meaning of the sonnet is that at no time, either in winter
or in summer, is nature silent. When the birds do not sing, the
grasshoppers make music for us; and when the cold has killed or
banished all other life, then the house cricket begins with its
thin sweet song to make us think of the dead voices of the
summer.</p>
<p>There is not much else of note about the grasshopper and the
cricket in the works of the great English poets. But perhaps you do
not know that Tennyson in his youth took up the subject and made a
long poem upon the grasshopper, but suppressed it after the edition
of 1842. He did not think it good enough to rank with his other
work. But a few months ago the poems which Tennyson suppressed in
the final edition of his works have been published and carefully
edited by an eminent scholar, and among these poems we find
&ldquo;The Grasshopper.&rdquo; I will quote some of this poem,
because it is beautiful, and because the fact of its suppression
will serve to show you how very exact <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page183" name="page183">[183]</a></span>and careful Tennyson was
to preserve only the very best things that he wrote.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>Joy of the summer plain,</p>
<p>Life of the summer hours,</p>

<p class="i2"><em>Sans peur et sans reproche</em>.</p>
<p class="i2">In sunlight and in shadow,</p>
<p class="i2">The Bayard of the meadow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reference to Tithonus is a reference of course to a subject
afterwards beautifully elaborated in another poem by Tennyson, the
great poem of &ldquo;Tithonus.&rdquo; The Bayard here referred to
was the great French model of perfect chivalry, and is sometimes
called the last of the feudal knights. He was said to be without
fear and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name=
"page184">[184]</a></span>without blame. You may remember that he
was killed by a ball from a gun&mdash;it was soon after the use of
artillery in war had been introduced; and his dying words were to
the effect that he feared there was now an end of great deeds,
because men had begun to fight from a distance with machines
instead of fighting in the old knightly and noble way with sword
and spear. The grasshopper, covered with green plates and bearing
so many little sharp spines upon its long limbs, seems to have
suggested to Tennyson the idea of a fairy knight in green
armour.</p>
<p>As I said before, England is poor in singing insects, while
America is rich in them&mdash;almost, perhaps, as rich as Japan,
although you will not find as many different kinds of singing
insects in any one state or district. The singing insects of
America are peculiar to particular localities. But the Eastern
states have perhaps the most curious insect of this kind. It is
called the Katydid. This name is spelt either Katydid, or
Catydid&mdash;though the former spelling is preferable. Katy, or
Katie, is the abbreviation of the name Catherine; very few girls
are called by the full name Catherine, also spelt Katherine;
because the name is long and unmusical, their friends address them
usually as Katy, and their acquaintances, as Kate. Well, the insect
of which I am speaking, a kind of <em>semi</em>, makes a sound
resembling the sound of the words &ldquo;Katie did!&rdquo; Hence
the name&mdash;one of the few <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"
name="page185">[185]</a></span>corresponding to the names given to
the Japanese <em>semi</em>, such as <em>tsuku-tsuku-boshi</em>, or
<em>minmin-semi</em>. The most interesting composition upon this
cicada is by Oliver Wendell Holmes, but it is of the lighter sort
of verse, with a touch of humour in it. I shall quote a few verses
only, as the piece contains some allusions that would require
explanation at considerable length.</p>

</div>
<p>The word &ldquo;testy&rdquo; may be a little unfamiliar to some
of you; it is a good old-fashioned English term for
&ldquo;cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;irritable.&rdquo; The reference to the
&ldquo;old gentlefolks&rdquo; implies the well-known fact that in
argument old persons are inclined to be much more obstinate than
young people. And there is also a hint in the poem of the tendency
among old ladies to blame the conduct of young girls even more
severely than may be necessary. There is nothing else to recommend
the poem except its wit and the curiousness of the subject. There
are several other verses about the same creature, by different
American poets; but none of them is quite so good as the
composition of Holmes. However, I may cite a few verses from one of
the earlier American poets, Philip Freneau, who flourished in the
eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth. He long
anticipated the fancy of Holmes; but he spells the word
Catydid.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In a branch of willow hid</p>
<p>Sings the evening Catydid:</p>
<p>From the lofty locust bough</p>
<p>Feeding on a drop of dew,</p>
<p>In her suit of green arrayed</p>
<p>Hear her singing in the shade&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Catydid, Catydid, Catydid!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name=

<p>Or repose your little head</p>

<p>All the day you nothing said;</p>
<p>Half the night your cheery tongue</p>
<p>Revelled out its little song,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Nothing else but Catydid.</p>
</div>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="stanza">
<p>Tell me, what did Caty do?</p>
<p>Did she mean to trouble you?</p>
<p>Why was Caty not forbid</p>
<p>To trouble little Catydid?</p>
<p>Wrong, indeed, at you to fling,</p>
<p>Hurting no one while you sing,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Catydid! Catydid! Catydid!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To Dr. Holmes the voice of the cicada seemed like the voice of
an old obstinate woman, an old prude, accusing a young girl of some
fault,&mdash;but to Freneau the cry of the little creature seemed
rather to be like the cry of a little child complaining&mdash;a
little girl, perhaps, complaining that somebody had been throwing
stones at her, or had hurt her in some way. And, of course, the
unfinished character of the phrase allows equally well either
supposition.</p>
<p>Before going back to more serious poetry, I want&mdash;while we
are speaking of American poets&mdash;to make one reference to the
ironical or satirical poetry which insects have inspired in some
minds, taking for example the poem by Charlotte Perkins Stetson
about a butterfly. This author is <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page188" name="page188">[188]</a></span>rather a person of note,
being a prominent figure in educational reforms and the author of a
volume of poems of a remarkably strong kind in the didactic sense.
In other words, she is especially a moral poet; and unless moral
poetry be really very well executed, it is scarcely worth while
classing it as literature. I think, however, that the symbolism in
the following verses will interest you&mdash;especially when we
comment upon them. The composition from which they are taken is
entitled &ldquo;A Conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poet, walking in the garden one morning, sees a butterfly,
very unhappy, and gifted with power to express the reason of its
unhappiness. The butterfly says, complaining of its wings,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;My legs are thin and few</p>
<p>Where once I had a swarm!</p>
<p>Soft fuzzy fur&mdash;a joy to view&mdash;</p>
<p>Once kept my body warm,</p>
<p>Before these flapping wing-things grew,</p>
<p>To hamper and deform!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>At that outrageous bug I shot</p>
<p>The fury of mine eye;</p>
<p>Said I, in scorn all burning hot,</p>
<p>In rage and anger high,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ignominious idiot!</p>
<p>Those wings are made to fly!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to fly,&rdquo; said he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want to squirm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he drooped his wings dejectedly,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name=
"page189">[189]</a></span>
<p>But still his voice was firm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to be a fly!</p>
<p>I want to be a worm!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>O yesterday of unknown lack!</p>
<p>To-day of unknown bliss!</p>
<p>I left my fool in red and black,</p>
<p>The last I saw was this,&mdash;</p>
<p>The creature madly climbing back</p>
<p>Into his chrysalis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of course the wings here represent the powers of the
mind&mdash;knowledge, reason, will. Men ought to use these in order
to reach still nobler and higher states of life. But there are men
who refuse to use their best faculties for this end. Such men are
like butterflies who do not want to take the trouble to fly, but
prefer the former condition of the caterpillar which does nothing
but eat and sleep. As applied to certain forms of conservatism the
satire is strong.</p>
<p>Something may now be said as to poems about spiders. But let me
remind you that a spider is not an insect. Scientifically it has no
relation to the great family of true insects; it belongs to the
very distinct family of the arthropoda or
&ldquo;joint-footed&rdquo; animals. But as it is still popularly
called an insect in most European countries, we may be excused for
including it in the subject of the present lecture. I suppose you
know that one of the scientific names for this whole class of
creatures is Arachnida,&mdash;a name derived from the Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name=
"page190">[190]</a></span>name Arachne. The story of Arachne is
interesting, and everybody studying natural history ought to know
it. Arachne was a young girl, according to the Greek story, who was
very skilful at weaving. She wove cloths of many different colours
and beautiful patterns, and everybody admired her work. This made
her vain&mdash;so vain that at last she said that even the goddess
of weaving could not weave better than she. Immediately after she
had said that, the terrible goddess herself&mdash;Pallas
Athena&mdash;entered the room. Pallas Athena was not only the
goddess of wisdom, you know, but especially the goddess of young
girls, presiding over the chastity, the filial piety, and the
domestic occupations of virgins; and she was very angry at the
conceit of this girl. So she said to her, &ldquo;You have boasted
that you can weave as well as I can; now let me see you
weave!&rdquo; So Arachne was obliged to sit down at her loom and
weave in the presence of the goddess; and the goddess also wove,
far surpassing the weaving of Arachne. When the weaving was done,
the goddess asked the girl, &ldquo;Now see! which is the better, my
work or yours?&rdquo; And Arachne was obliged to confess that she
had been defeated and put to shame. But the goddess was not
thoroughly satisfied; to punish Arachne, she touched her lightly
with the distaff, saying, &ldquo;Spin forever!&rdquo; and thereupon
Arachne was changed into a spider, which forever spins and weaves
perishable films of perishable <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page191" name="page191">[191]</a></span>shiny thread. Poetically
we still may call a spider Arachne.</p>
<p>I have here a little poem of a touching character entitled
&ldquo;Arachne,&rdquo; by Rose Terry Cooke,&mdash;one of the
symbolic poems which are becoming so numerous in these days of
newer and deeper philosophy. I think that you will like it: a
spinster, that is, a maiden passed the age of girlhood, is the
speaker.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I watch her in the corner there,</p>
<p>As, restless, bold, and unafraid,</p>
<p>She slips and floats along the air</p>
<p>Till all her subtile house is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Her home, her bed, her daily food,</p>
<p>All from that hidden store she draws;</p>
<p>She fashions it and knows it good,</p>
<p>By instinct&rsquo;s strong and sacred laws.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>No tenuous threads to weave her nest,</p>
<p>She seeks and gathers there or here;</p>
<p>But spins it from her faithful breast,</p>
<p>Renewing still, till leaves are sere.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then, worn with toil, and tired of life,</p>
<p>In vain her shining traps are set.</p>
<p>Her frost hath hushed the insect strife</p>
<p>And gilded flies her charm forget.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But swinging in the snares she spun,</p>
<p>She sways to every wintry wind:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name=
"page192">[192]</a></span>
<p>Her joy, her toil, her errand done,</p>
<p>Her corse the sport of storms unkind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The symbolism of these verses will appear to you more
significant when I tell you that it refers especially to conditions
in New England in the present period. The finest American
population&mdash;perhaps the finest Anglo-Saxons ever
produced&mdash;were the New Englanders of the early part of the
century. But with the growth of the new century, the men found
themselves attracted elsewhere, especially westward; their
shrewdness, their energies, their inventiveness, were needed in
newer regions. And they wandered away by thousands and thousands,
never to come back again, and leaving the women behind them.
Gradually the place of these men was taken by immigrants of
inferior development&mdash;but the New England women had nothing to
hope for from these strangers. The bravest of them also went away
to other states; but myriads who could not go were condemned by
circumstances to stay and earn their living by hard work without
any prospect of happy marriage. The difficulty which a girl of
culture may experience in trying to live by the work of her hands
in New England is something not easily imagined. But it is getting
to be the same in most Western countries. Such a girl is watching a
spider weaving in the corner of the same room where she herself is
weaving; and she thinks, &ldquo;Am I not like that spider, obliged
to supply <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name=
"page193">[193]</a></span>my every need by the work of my own
hands, without sympathy, without friends? The spider will spin and
catch flies until the autumn comes; then she will die. Perhaps I
too must continue to spin until the autumn of my own
life&mdash;until I become too old to work hard, and die of cold and
of exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Poor sister of the spinster clan!</p>

course, implies the pain often caused to such hardworking girls by
the meanness of men who employ them only to cheat
them&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name=
"page194">[194]</a></span>shopkeepers or manufacturers who take
their work without justly paying for it, and who criticize it as
bad in order to force the owner to accept less money than it is
worth. Again a reference may be intended to the destruction of the
home by some legal trick&mdash;some unscrupulous method of cheating
the daughter out of the property bequeathed to her by her
parents.</p>
<p>Notice a few pretty words here. The &ldquo;pearled&rdquo; as
applied to the spider&rsquo;s thread gives an intimation of the
effect produced by dew on the thread, but there is also the
suggestion of tears upon the thread work woven by the hands of the
girl. The participle &ldquo;anchored&rdquo; is very pretty in its
use here as an adjective, because this word is now especially used
for rope-fastening, whether the rope be steel or hemp; and
particularly for the fastening of the cables of a bridge. The last
stanza might be paraphrased thus: &ldquo;Sister Spider, I know more
than you&mdash;and that knowledge makes me unhappy. You do not
know, when you are spinning your little web, that you are really
weaving your own shroud. But I know this, my work is slowly but
surely killing me. And I know it because I have a soul&mdash;at
least a mind made otherwise than yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of the word &ldquo;soul&rdquo; in the last stanza of
this poem, brings me back to the question put forth in an earlier
part of the lecture&mdash;why European poets, during the last two
thousand years, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name=
"page195">[195]</a></span>have written so little upon the subject
of insects? Three thousand, four thousand years ago, the most
beautiful Greek poetry&mdash;poetry more perfect than anything of
English poetry&mdash;was written upon insects. In old Japanese
literature poems upon insects are to be found by thousands. What is
the signification of the great modern silence in Western countries
upon this delightful topic? I believe that Christianity, as dogma,
accounts for the long silence. The opinions of the early Church
refused soul, ghost, intelligence of any sort to other creatures
than man. All animals were considered as automata&mdash;that is, as
self-acting machines, moved by a something called instinct, for
want of a better name. To talk about the souls of animals or the
spirits of animals would have been very dangerous in the Middle
Ages, when the Church had supreme power; it would indeed have been
to risk or to invite an accusation of witchcraft, for demons were
then thought to take the shape of animals at certain times. To
discuss the <em>mind</em> of an animal would have been for the
Christian faith to throw doubt upon the existence of human souls as
taught by the Church; for if you grant that animals are able to
think, then you must acknowledge that man is able to think without
a soul, or you must acknowledge that the soul is not the essential
principle of thought and action. Until after the time of Descartes,
who later argued philosophically that animals were only machines,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name=
"page196">[196]</a></span>it was scarcely possible to argue
rationally about the matter in Europe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we shall soon perceive that this explanation will
not cover all the facts. You will naturally ask how it happens
that, if the question be a question of animal souls, birds, horses,
dogs, cats, and many other animals have been made the subject of
Western poems from ancient times. The silence is only upon the
subject of insects. And, again, Christianity has one
saint&mdash;the most beautiful character in all Christian
hagiography&mdash;who thought of all nature in a manner that, at
first sight, strangely resembles Buddhism. This saint was Francis
of Assisi, born in the latter part of the twelfth century, so that
he may be said to belong to the very heart of the Middle
Ages,&mdash;the most superstitious epoch of Christianity. Now this
saint used to talk to trees and stones as if they were animated
beings. He addressed the sun as &ldquo;my brother sun&rdquo;; and
he spoke of the moon as his sister. He preached not only to human
beings, but also to the birds and the fishes; and he made a great
many poems on these subjects, full of a strange and childish
beauty. For example, his sermon to the doves, beginning, &ldquo;My
little sisters, the doves,&rdquo; in which he reminds them that
their form is the emblem or symbol of the Holy Ghost, is a
beautiful poem; and has been, with many others, translated into
nearly all modern languages. But observe that neither St. Francis
nor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name=
"page197">[197]</a></span>any other saint has anything to say on
the subject of insects.</p>
<p>Perhaps we must go back further than Christianity to guess the
meaning of these distinctions. Among the ancient races of Asia,
where the Jewish faith arose, there were strange and sinister
beliefs about insects&mdash;old Assyrian superstitions, old
Babylonian beliefs. Insects seemed to those early peoples very
mysterious creatures (which they really are); and it appears to
have been thought that they had a close relation to the world of
demons and evil spirits. I suppose you know that the name of one of
their gods, Beelzebub, signifies the Lord of Flies. The Jews, as is
shown by their Talmudic literature, inherited some of these ideas;
and it is quite probable that they were passed on to the days of
Christianity. Again, in the early times of Christianity in Northern
Africa the Church had to fight against superstitions of an equally
strange sort derived from old Egyptian beliefs. Among the
Egyptians, certain insects were sacred and became symbols of
divinity,&mdash;such as the beetle. Now I imagine that for these
reasons the subject of insects became at an early time a subject
which Christianity thought dangerous, and that thereafter a kind of
hostile opinion prevailed regarding any literature upon this
topic.</p>
<p>However, to-day things are very different. With the development
of scientific studies&mdash;especially of microscopic
study&mdash;it has been found that <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page198" name="page198">[198]</a></span>insects, far from being
the lowliest of creatures, are the most highly organized of all
beings; that their special senses are incomparably superior to our
own; and that in natural history, from the evolutional standpoint,
they have to be given first place. This of course renders it
impossible any longer to consider the insect as a trifling subject.
Moreover, the new philosophy is teaching the thinking classes in
all Western countries the great truth of the unity of life. With
the recognition of such unity, an insect must interest the
philosophers&mdash;even the man of ordinary culture&mdash;quite as
much as the bird or any other animal.</p>
<p>Nearly all the poems which I have quoted to you have been poems
of very modern date&mdash;from which we may infer that interest in
the subject of insects has been developing of late years only. In
this connection it is interesting to note that a very religious
poet, Whittier, gave us in the last days of his life a poem upon
ants. This would have seemed strange enough in a former age; it
does not seem strange to-day, and it is beautiful. The subject is
taken from old Jewish literature.</p>
<h4>KING SOLOMON AND THE ANTS</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Out from Jerusalem</p>
<p class="i2">The King rode with his great</p>

<p>And Sheba&rsquo;s queen with them;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name=

<p>Comely, but black withal,</p>
<p class="i2">To whom, perchance, belongs</p>
<p class="i2">That wondrous Song of Songs,</p>
<p>Sensuous and mystical,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whereto devout souls turn</p>
<p class="i2">In fond, ecstatic dream,</p>
<p class="i2">And through its earth-born theme</p>
<p>The Love of Loves discern.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Proud in the Syrian sun,</p>
<p class="i2">In gold and purple sheen,</p>
<p class="i2">The dusky Ethiop queen</p>
<p>Smiled on King Solomon.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Wisest of men, he knew</p>
<p class="i2">The languages of all</p>
<p class="i2">The creatures great or small</p>
<p>That trod the earth or flew.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Across an ant-hill led</p>
<p class="i2">The king&rsquo;s path, and he heard</p>
<p class="i2">Its small folk, and their word</p>
<p>He thus interpreted:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the king men greet</p>
<p class="i2">As wise and good and just,</p>
<p class="i2">To crush us in the dust</p>
<p>Under his heedless feet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The king, understanding the language of insects, turns to the
queen and explains to her what the ants have just said. She advises
him to pay no <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name=
"page200">[200]</a></span>attention to the sarcasm of the
ants&mdash;how dare such vile creatures speak thus about a king!
But Solomon thinks otherwise:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; Solomon replied,</p>
<p class="i2">&ldquo;The wise and strong should seek</p>
<p class="i2">The welfare of the weak,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turned his horse aside.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>His train, with quick alarm,</p>
<p class="i2">Curved with their leader round</p>
<p class="i2">The ant-hill&rsquo;s peopled mound,</p>
<p>And left it free from harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The jewelled head bent low;</p>
<p class="i2">&ldquo;Oh, king!&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;henceforth</p>
<p class="i2">The secret of thy worth</p>
<p>And wisdom well I know.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Happy must be the State</p>
<p class="i2">Whose ruler heedeth more</p>
<p class="i2">The murmurs of the poor</p>
<p>Than flatteries of the great.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reference to the Song of Songs&mdash;also the Song of
Solomon and Canticle of Canticles&mdash;may require a little
explanation. The line &ldquo;Comely but black withal,&rdquo; is
borrowed from a verse of this song&mdash;&ldquo;I am black but
beautiful, oh, ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as
the curtains of Solomon.&rdquo; In another part of the song the
reason of this blackness is given: &ldquo;I am black, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201">[201]</a></span>because
the sun hath looked upon me.&rdquo; From which we can see that the
word black only means dark, brown, tanned by the sun. Perhaps you
do not know that as late as the middle of the eighteenth century it
was still the custom in England to speak of a person with black
hair and eyes as &ldquo;a black man&rdquo;&mdash;a custom which
Charles Lamb had reason to complain of even at a later day. The
tents referred to in the text were probably tents made of
camel-skin, such as the Arabs still make, and the colour of these
is not black but brown. Whether Solomon wrote the so-called song or
not we do not know; but the poet refers to a legend that it was
written in praise of the beauty of the dark queen who came from
Sheba to visit the wisest man of the world. Such is not, however,
the opinion of modern scholars. The composition is really dramatic,
although thrown into lyrical form, and as arranged by Renan and
others it becomes a beautiful little play, of which each act is a
monologue. &ldquo;Sensuous&rdquo; the poet correctly calls it; for
it is a form of praise of woman&rsquo;s beauty in all its details,
as appears in such famous verses as these: &ldquo;How beautiful are
thy feet in shoes, O prince&rsquo;s daughter; the joints of thy
thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed
among the lilies.&rdquo; But Christianity, instead of dismissing
this part of the Bible, interpreted the song <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page202" name=
"page202">[202]</a></span>mystically&mdash;insisting that the woman
described meant the Church, and the lover, Christ. Of course only
very pious people continue to believe this; even the good Whittier
preferred the legend that it was written about the Queen of
Sheba.</p>
<p>I suppose that I ought to end this lecture upon insect poetry by
some quotation to which a moral or philosophical meaning can be
attached. I shall end it therefore with a quotation from the poet
Gray. The poetry of insects may be said to have first appeared in
English literature during the second half of the eighteenth
century, so that it is only, at the most, one hundred and fifty
years old. But the first really fine poem of the eighteenth century
relating to the subject is quite as good as anything since composed
by Englishmen upon insect life in general. Perhaps Gray referred
especially to what we call May-flies&mdash;those delicate ghostly
insects which hover above water surfaces in fine weather, but which
die on the same day that they are born. He does not specify
May-flies, however, and we may consider the moral of the poem quite
apart from any particular kind of insect. You will find this
reference in the piece entitled &ldquo;Ode on the Spring,&rdquo; in
the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Still is the toiling hand of care:</p>
<p class="i2">The panting herds repose:</p>
<p>Yet hark, how through the peopled air</p>
<p>The busy murmur glows!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name=
"page203">[203]</a></span>
<p>The insect youth are on the wing,</p>
<p>Eager to taste the honied spring,</p>
<p>And float amid the liquid noon:</p>
<p>Some lightly o&rsquo;er the current skim,</p>
<p>Some show their gaily-gilded trim</p>
<p class="i2">Quick-glancing to the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>To Contemplation&rsquo;s sober eye</p>
<p class="i2">Such is the race of man:</p>
<p>And they that creep, and they that fly,</p>
<p class="i2">Shall end where they began.</p>
<p>Alike the Busy and the Gay</p>
<p>But flutter through life&rsquo;s little day,</p>
<p>In fortune&rsquo;s varying colours dressed:</p>
<p>Brushed by the hand of rough Mischance,</p>
<p>Or chilled by Age, their airy dance</p>
<p class="i2">They leave, in dust to rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Methinks I hear in accents low</p>
<p class="i2">The sportive kind reply:</p>
<p>Poor moralist! and what art thou?</p>
<p class="i2">A solitary fly!</p>
<p>Thy joys no glittering female meets,</p>
<p>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,</p>
<p>No painted plumage to display:</p>
<p>On hasty wings thy youth is flown;</p>
<p>Thy sun is set; thy spring is gone&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">We frolic, while &rsquo;tis May.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poet Gray was never married, and the last stanza which I
have quoted refers jocosely to himself. It is an artistic device to
set off the moral by a little mockery, so that it may not appear
too melancholy.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_11" name="Ch_11">Chapter XI</a></h3>
<h2>Some French Poems about Insects</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Last year I gave a lecture on the subject of English poems about
insects, with some reference to the old Greek poems on the same
subject. But I did not then have an opportunity to make any
reference to French poems upon the same subject, and I think that
it would be a pity not to give you a few examples.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of English poems about insects, nearly all
the French literature upon this subject is new. Insect poetry
belongs to the newer and larger age of thought, to the age that
begins to perceive the great truth of the unity of life. We no
longer find, even in natural histories, the insect treated as a
mere machine and unthinking organism; on the contrary its habits,
its customs and its manifestation both of intelligence and instinct
are being very carefully studied in these times, and a certain
sympathy, as well as a certain feeling of respect or admiration,
may be found in the scientific treatises of the greatest men who
write about insect life. So, naturally, Europe is slowly returning
to the poetical standpoint of the old Greeks in this respect. It is
not improbable that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name=
"page205">[205]</a></span>keeping caged insects as pets may again
become a Western custom, as it was in Greek times, when cages were
made of rushes or straw for the little creatures. I suppose you
have heard that the Japanese custom is very likely to become a
fashion in America. If that should really happen, the fact would
certainly have an effect upon poetry. I think that it is very
likely to happen.</p>
<p>The French poets who have written pretty things about insects
are nearly all poets of our own times. Some of them treat the
subject from the old Greek standpoint&mdash;indeed the beautiful
poem of Heredia upon the tomb of a grasshopper is perfectly Greek,
and reads almost like a translation from the Greek. Other poets try
to express the romance of insects in the form of a monologue, full
of the thought of our own age. Others again touch the subject of
insects only in connection with the subject of love. I will give
one example of each method, keeping the best piece for the last,
and beginning with a pretty fancy about a dragonfly.</p>
<h4>MA LIBELLULE</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>En te voyant, toute mignonne,</p>
<p>Blanche dans ta robe d&rsquo;azure,</p>
<p>Je pensais &agrave; quelque madone</p>
<p>Drap&eacute;e en un pen de ciel pur.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Je songeais &agrave; ces belles saintes</p>
<p>Que l&rsquo;on voyait au temps jadis</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name=
"page206">[206]</a></span>
<p>Sourire sur les vitres peintes,</p>
<p>Montrant d&rsquo;un doigt le paradis:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Et j&rsquo;aurais voulu, loin du monde</p>
<p>Qui passait frivole entre nous,</p>
<p>Dans quelque retraite profonde</p>
<p>T&rsquo;adorer seul &agrave; deux genoux.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This first part of the poem is addressed of course to a
beautiful child, some girl between the age of childhood and
womanhood:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beholding thee, Oh darling one, all white in thy azure
dress, I thought of some figure of the Madonna robed in a shred of
pure blue sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed of those beautiful figures of saints whom one
used to see in olden times smiling in the stained glass of church
windows, and pointing upward to Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I could have wished to adore you alone upon my bended
knees in some far hidden retreat, away from the frivolous world
that passed between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little bit of ecstasy over the beauty and purity of a child
is pretty, but not particularly original. However, it is only an
introduction. Now comes the pretty part of the poem:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Soudain un caprice bizarre</p>
<p>Change la sc&egrave;ne et le d&eacute;cor,</p>
<p>Et mon esprit au loin s&rsquo;&eacute;gare</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name=
"page207">[207]</a></span>
<p>O&ugrave;, pr&egrave;s de ruisseaux muscules</p>
<p>Gazouillants comme des oiseaux,</p>
<p>Se poursuivent les libellules,</p>
<p>Ces fleurs vivantes des roseaux.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Enfant, n&rsquo;es tu pas l&rsquo;une d&rsquo;elles</p>
<p>Qui me poursuit pour consoler?</p>
<p>Vainement tu caches tes ailes;</p>
<p>Tu marches, mais tu sais voler.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Petite f&eacute;e au bleu corsage,</p>
<p>Que j&rsquo;ai connu d&egrave;s mon berceau,</p>
<p>En revoyant ton doux visage,</p>
<p>Je pense aux joncs de mon ruisseau!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Veux-tu qu&rsquo;en amoureux fid&egrave;les</p>
<p>Nous revenions dans ces pr&eacute;s verts?</p>
<p>Libellule, reprends tes ailes;</p>
<p>Moi, je brulerai tous mes vers!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Et nous irons, sous la lumi&egrave;re,</p>
<p>D&rsquo;un ciel plus frais et plus l&eacute;ger</p>
<p>Chacun dans sa forme premi&egrave;re,</p>
<p>Moi courir, et toi voltiger.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly a strange fancy changes for me the scene and the
scenery; and my mind wanders far away over great meadows of azure
and gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, hard by tiny streams that murmur with a sound like
voices of little birds, the dragon-flies, those living flowers of
the reeds, chase each other at play.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name=
"page208">[208]</a></span>&rdquo;Child, art thou not one of those
dragon-flies, following after me to console me? Ah, it is in vain
that thou tryest to hide thy wings; thou dost walk, indeed, but
well thou knowest how to fly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O little fairy with the blue corsage whom I knew even
from the time I was a baby in the cradle; seeing again thy sweet
face, I think of the rushes that border the little stream of my
native village!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou not wish that even now as faithful lovers we
return to those green fields? O dragon-fly, take thy wings again,
and I&mdash;I will burn all my poetry,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall go back, under the light of the sky more
fresh and pure than this, each of us in the original form&mdash;I
to run about, and thou to hover in the air as of yore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of a child&rsquo;s face has revived for the poet very
suddenly and vividly, the recollection of the village home, the
green fields of childhood, the little stream where he used to play
with the same little girl, sometimes running after the dragon-fly.
And now the queer fancy comes to him that she herself is so like a
dragon-fly&mdash;so light, graceful, spiritual! Perhaps really she
is a dragon-fly following him into the great city, where he
struggles to live as a poet, just in order to console him. She
hides her wings, but that is only to prevent other people knowing.
Why not return once more to the home of childhood, back to the
green fields <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name=
"page209">[209]</a></span>and the sun? &ldquo;Little
dragon-fly,&rdquo; he says to her, &ldquo;let us go back! do you
return to your beautiful summer shape, be a dragon-fly again,
expand your wings of gauze; and I shall stop trying to write
poetry. I shall burn my verses; I shall go back to the streams
where we played as children; I shall run about again with the joy
of a child, and with you beautifully flitting hither and thither as
a dragon-fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Hugo also has a little poem about a dragon-fly, symbolic
only, but quite pretty. It is entitled &ldquo;La Demoiselle&rdquo;;
and the other poem was entitled, as you remember, &ldquo;Ma
Libellule.&rdquo; Both words mean a dragon-fly, but not the same
kind of dragon-fly. The French word &ldquo;demoiselle,&rdquo; which
might be adequately rendered into Japanese by the term
<em>ojosan</em>, refers only to those exquisitely slender,
graceful, slow-flitting dragon-flies known to the scientist by the
name of Calopteryx. Of course you know the difference by sight, and
the reason of the French name will be poetically apparent to
you.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Quand la demoiselle dor&eacute;e</p>
<p>S&rsquo;envole au d&eacute;part des hivers,</p>
<p>Souvent sa robe diapr&eacute;e,</p>
<p>Souvent son aile est d&eacute;chir&eacute;e</p>
<p>Aux mille dards des buissons verts.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ainsi, jeunesse vive et fr&ecirc;le,</p>
<p>Qui, t&rsquo;&eacute;garant de tous c&ocirc;t&eacute;s,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name=
"page210">[210]</a></span>
<p>Voles ou ton instinct t&rsquo;appele,</p>
<p>Souvent tu d&eacute;chires ton aile</p>
<p>Aux &eacute;pines des voluptes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;When, at the departure of winter, the gilded dragon-fly
begins to soar, often her many-coloured robe, often her wing, is
torn by the thousand thorns of the verdant shrubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, O frail and joyous Youth, who, wandering hither
and thither, in every direction, flyest wherever thy instinct calls
thee&mdash;even so thou dost often tear thy wings upon the thorns
of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must understand that pleasure is compared to a rose-bush,
whose beautiful and fragrant flowers attract the insects, but whose
thorns are dangerous to the visitors. However, Victor Hugo does not
use the word for rose-bush, for obvious reasons; nor does he
qualify the plants which are said to tear the wings of the
dragon-fly. I need hardly tell you that the comparison would not
hold good in reference to the attraction of flowers, because
dragon-flies do not care in the least about flowers, and if they
happen to tear their wings among thorn bushes, it is much more
likely to be in their attempt to capture and devour other insects.
The merit of the poem is chiefly in its music and colour; as
natural history it would not bear criticism. The most beautiful
modern French poem about insects, beautiful because of its
classical perfection, is I think a sonnet by Heredia, entitled
&ldquo;&Eacute;pigramme Fun&eacute;raire&rdquo;&mdash;that is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name=
"page211">[211]</a></span>to say, &ldquo;Inscription for a
Tombstone.&rdquo; This is an exact imitation of Greek sentiment and
expression, carefully studied after the poets of the anthology.
Several such Greek poems are extant, recounting how children
mourned for pet insects which had died in spite of all their care.
The most celebrated one among these I quoted in a former
lecture&mdash;the poem about the little Greek girl Myro who made a
tomb for her grasshopper and cried over it. Heredia has very well
copied the Greek feeling in this fine sonnet:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ici g&icirc;t, Etranger, la verte sauterelle</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stranger, here reposes the green grasshopper that the
young girl Helle cared for during two <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page212" name="page212">[212]</a></span>seasons,&mdash;the
grasshopper whose wings, vibrating under the strokes of its
serrated feet, used to resound in the pine, the trefoil and the
whortleberry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is silent now, alas! that natural lyre, muse of the
unsown fields, of the furrows, and of the wheat. Lest her light
sleep should be disturbed, ah! pass quickly, friend! do not be
heavy upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is there. All white, in the midst of a tuft of thyme,
her funeral monument is placed, in cool shadow; how many men have
not been able to have this supremely happy end!</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the tears of a child the insect&rsquo;s tomb is
watered; and the pious goddess of dawn each morning there makes a
libation of drops of dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reads very imperfectly in a hasty translation; the original
charm is due to the perfect art of the form. But the whole thing,
as I have said before, is really Greek, and based upon a close
study of several little Greek poems on the same kind of subject.
Little Greek girls thousands of years ago used to keep singing
insects as pets, every day feeding them with slices of leek and
with fresh water, putting in their little cages sprigs of the
plants which they liked. The sorrow of the child for the inevitable
death of her insect pets at the approach of winter, seems to have
inspired many Greek poets. With all tenderness, the child would
make a small grave for the insect, bury it solemnly, and put a
little white stone above the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213"
name="page213">[213]</a></span>place to imitate a grave-stone. But
of course she would want an inscription for this
tombstone&mdash;perhaps would ask some of her grown-up friends to
compose one for her. Sometimes the grown-up friend might be a poet,
in which case he would compose an epitaph for all time.</p>
<p>I suppose you perceive that the solemnity of this imitation of
the Greek poems on the subject is only a tender mockery, a playful
sympathy with the real grief of the child. The expression,
&ldquo;pass, friend,&rdquo; is often found in Greek funeral
inscriptions together with the injunction to tread lightly upon the
dust of the dead. There is one French word to which I will call
attention,&mdash;the word &ldquo;gu&eacute;rets.&rdquo; We have no
English equivalent for this term, said to be a corruption of the
Latin word &ldquo;veractum,&rdquo; and meaning fields which have
been ploughed but not sown.</p>
<p>Not to dwell longer upon the phase of art indicated by this
poem, I may turn to the subject of crickets. There are many French
poems about crickets. One by Lamartine is known to almost every
French child.</p>

<p>It is a young girl who thus addresses the cricket <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215">[215]</a></span>of the
hearth, the house cricket. It is very common in country houses in
Europe. This is what she says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little solitary cricket, all alone here just like myself,
little voice that comes up out of the ground, ah, awake for my
sake! I am stirring up the fires, that is just to make you
comfortable; but there lacks a presence by the hearth; a soul to
keep me company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a very little girl, as little as that cradle
in the corner of the room, then, while Margaret our servant sat
there spinning, and while the autumn wind made everything moan
outside, your monotonous cry used to help me to fall asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solitary cricket, voice that issues from the ground,
awaken, for my sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am sixteen years of age and you are still nestling
in the chimneys as of old. I can hear you still in the cold
season,&mdash;like a sound&mdash;memory,&mdash;a sonorous memory of
old houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solitary cricket, voice that issues from the ground,
awaken, O awaken for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not think this pretty little song needs any explanation; I
would only call your attention to the natural truth of the fancy
and the feeling. Sitting alone by the fire in the night, the maiden
wants to hear the cricket sing, because it makes her think of her
childhood, and she finds happiness in remembering it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name=
"page216">[216]</a></span>So far as mere art goes, the poem of
Gautier on the cricket is very much finer than the poem of
Lamartine, though not so natural and pleasing. But as Gautier was
the greatest master of French verse in the nineteenth century, not
excepting Victor Hugo, I think that one example of his poetry on
insects may be of interest. He was very poor, compared with Victor
Hugo; and he had to make his living by writing for newspapers, so
that he had no time to become the great poet that nature intended
him to be. However, he did find time to produce one volume of
highly finished poetry, which is probably the most perfect verse of
the nineteenth century, if not the most perfect verse ever made by
a French poet; I mean the &ldquo;Emaux et Cam&eacute;es.&rdquo; But
the little poem which I am going to read to you is not from the
&ldquo;Emaux et Cam&eacute;es.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This poem is especially picturesque, and is intended to give us
the comfortable sensations of a winter night by the fire, and the
amusement of watching the wood burn and of hearing the kettle
boiling. You will find that the French has a particular quality of
lucid expression; it is full of clearness and colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow on, cold wind! pour down, O rain. I, in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218">[218]</a></span>my
soot-black palace, laugh at both rain and wind; and while waiting
for winter to pass I remain in my corner by the fire dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I that am really the spirit of the hearth! The
gaseous flame licks the wood more softly with its bluish tongue
when it hears me; and the smoke rises up like an alabaster thread,
and curls itself about (or twists) at the sound of my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kettle chuckles and chatters; the golden-footed flame
leaps, dancing to the accompaniment of my song (or in accompaniment
to my song); the great log covers itself with down, the sap boils
in the wooden embers (&ldquo;duvet,&rdquo; meaning
&ldquo;down,&rdquo; refers to the soft fluffy white ash that forms
upon the surface of burning wood).</p>
<p>&ldquo;All night and all day I sing below the chimney. Often in
my cricket-language, I have consoled Cinderella for the snubs of
her elder sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what pleasure to sit up at night, and watch the
crimson flames embracing the wood (or hugging the wood) with both
arms at once, and to listen to all the sounds and to hear the life
of the house!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nestling in one&rsquo;s good warm nook, how pleasant to
hear Winter, who weeps and prowls round about the house outside,
all wan and blue-nosed with cold, trying to smuggle itself inside
some chink in the shutter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course this does not give us much about the insect itself,
which remains invisible in the poem, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page219" name="page219">[219]</a></span>just as it really remains
invisible in the house where the voice is heard. Rather does the
poem express the feelings of the person who hears the cricket.</p>
<p>When we come to the subject of grasshoppers, I think that the
French poets have done much better than the English. There are many
poems on the field grasshopper; I scarcely know which to quote
first. But I think you would be pleased with a little composition
by the celebrated French painter, Jules Breton. Like Rossetti he
was both painter and poet; and in both arts he took for his
subjects by preference things from country life. This little poem
is entitled &ldquo;Les Cigales.&rdquo; The word
&ldquo;cigales,&rdquo; though really identical with our word
&ldquo;cicala,&rdquo; seldom means the same thing. Indeed the
French word may mean several different kinds of insects, and it is
only by studying the text that we can feel quite sure what sort of
insect is meant.</p>

<p>Son oeil de bronze fixe et tendu vers l&rsquo;azur,</p>
<p>II expire en chantant sur la tige s&eacute;ch&eacute;e.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the word &ldquo;encolure&rdquo; we have no English
equivalent; it means the line of the neck and
shoulder&mdash;sometimes the general appearance of shape of the
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When in the ripening grain field not a single ear of
wheat moves; when in the beaming heat the corn seems to crackle;
when the poppy languishes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221"
name="page221">[221]</a></span>and bends down under the feeble
burden of its scarlet corolla,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all the birds of the air have hushed their songs;
even the indolent doves, seeking the darkest part of the foliage in
the tree, have become drowsy in the woods, and have ceased their
cooing, far from the fields, which the silent sun is burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, in the wheat, the brave grasshoppers
uttering their thousand sounds, a trumpet flourish of summer, have
continued furiously and unceasingly to smite their wings upon the
brass of their wild cymbal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quivering as they stand upon the long gold ears of the
grain, master musicians who must die before the coming of Fall,
they sound to heaven their monotonous hymn, which re-echoes even in
the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing will check their inexhaustible shrilling.
When chased away from the oats and from the wheat, they will
migrate to the scorched bushes which die of thirst in the wastes of
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the leafless shrubs, upon the dried up thistles,
which let their white hair fall and float away, there the
sturdily-built insect can be seen again, filled with enthusiasm,
even more and more excited as he cries,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until, at last, opening his wings, now rent into shreds,
exasperated, burning more and more <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page222" name="page222">[222]</a></span>fiercely in the frenzy of
his excitement, and with his eyes of bronze always fixed
motionlessly upon the azure sky, he dies in his song upon the
withered grain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is difficult to translate at all satisfactorily, owing to
the multitude of images compressed together. But the idea expressed
is a fine one&mdash;the courage of the insect challenging the sun,
and only chanting more and more as the heat and the thirst
increase. The poem has, if you like, the fault of exaggeration, but
the colour and music are very fine; and even the exaggeration
itself has the merit of making the images more vivid.</p>
<p>It will not be necessary to quote another text; we shall
scarcely have the time; but I want to translate to you something of
another poem upon the same insect by the modern French poet Jean
Aicard. In this poem, as in the little poem by Gautier, which I
quoted to you, the writer puts his thought in the mouth of the
insect, so to say&mdash;that is, makes the insect tell its own
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the impassive and noble insect that sings in the
summer solstice from the dazzling dawn all the day long in the
fragrant pine-wood. And my song is always the same, regular as the
equal course of the season and of the sun. I am the speech of the
hot and beaming sun, and when the reapers, weary of heaping the
sheaves together, lie down in the lukewarm shade, and sleep and
pant in the ardour of noonday&mdash;then more <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223">[223]</a></span>than at
any other time do I utter freely and joyously that double-echoing
strophe with which my whole body vibrates. And when nothing else
moves in all the land round about, I palpitate and loudly sound my
little drum. Otherwise the sunlight triumphs; and in the whole
landscape nothing is heard but my cry,&mdash;like the joy of the
light itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a butterfly I take up from the hearts of the flowers
that pure water which the night lets fall into them like tears. I
am inspired only by the almighty sun. Socrates listened to me;
Virgil made mention of me. I am the insect especially beloved by
the poets and by the bards. The ardent sun reflects himself in the
globes of my eyes. My ruddy bed, which seems to be powdered like
the surface of fine ripe fruit, resembles some exquisite key-board
of silver and gold, all quivering with music. My four wings, with
their delicate net-work of nerves, allow the bright down upon my
black back to be seen through their transparency. And like a star
upon the forehead of some divinely inspired poet, three exquisitely
mounted rubies glitter upon my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are fair examples of the French manner of treating the
interesting subject of insects in poetry. If you should ask me
whether the French poets are better than the English, I should
answer, &ldquo;In point of feeling, no.&rdquo; The real value of
such examples to the student should be emotional, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224">[224]</a></span>not
descriptive. I think that the Japanese poems on insects, though not
comparable in point of mere form with some of the foreign poems
which I have quoted, are better in another way&mdash;they come
nearer to the true essence of poetry. For the Japanese poets have
taken the subject of insects chiefly for the purpose of suggesting
human emotion; and that is certainly the way in which such a
subject should be used. Remember that this is an age in which we
are beginning to learn things about insects which could not have
been even imagined fifty years ago, and the more that we learn
about these miraculous creatures, the more difficult does it become
for us to write poetically about their lives, or about their
possible ways of thinking and feeling. Probably no mortal man will
ever be able to imagine how insects think or feel or hear or even
see. Not only are their senses totally different from those of
animals, but they appear to have a variety of special senses about
which we can not know anything at all. As for their existence, it
is full of facts so atrocious and so horrible as to realize most of
the imaginations of old about the torments of hell. Now, for these
reasons to make an insect speak in poetry&mdash;to put one&rsquo;s
thoughts, so to speak, into the mouth of an insect&mdash;is no
longer consistent with poetical good judgment. No; we must think of
insects either in relation to the mystery of their marvellous
lives, or in relation to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225"
name="page225">[225]</a></span>emotion which their sweet and
melancholy music makes within our minds. The impressions produced
by hearing the shrilling of crickets at night or by hearing the
storm of cicad&aelig; in summer woods&mdash;those impressions
indeed are admirable subjects for poetry, and will continue to be
for all time.</p>
<p>When I lectured to you long ago about Greek and English poems on
insects, I told you that nearly all the English poems on the
subject were quite modern. I still believe that I was right in this
statement, as a general assertion; but I have found one quaint poem
about a grasshopper, which must have been written about the middle
of the seventeenth century or, perhaps, a little earlier. The date
of the author&rsquo;s birth and death are respectively 1618 and
1658. His name, I think, you are familiar with&mdash;Richard
Lovelace, author of many amatory poems, and of one especially
famous song, &ldquo;To Lucasta, on Going to the
Wars&rdquo;&mdash;containing the celebrated stanza&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p class="i2">As you too shall adore;</p>
<p>I could not love thee, Dear, so much,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Well, as I said, this man wrote one pretty little poem on a
grasshopper, which antedates most of the English poems on insects,
if not all of them.</p>

<p class="i2">Thyself, and melancholy streams.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A little artificial, this poem written at least two hundred and
fifty years ago; but it is pretty in spite of its artifice. Some of
the conceits are so quaint that they must be explained. By the term
&ldquo;oaten beard,&rdquo; the poet means an ear of oats; and you
know that the grain of this plant is furnished with very long hair,
so that many poets have spoken of the bearded oats. You may
remember in this connection Tennyson&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;the
bearded barley&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Lady of Shalott,&rdquo; and
Longfellow&rsquo;s term &ldquo;bearded grain&rdquo; in his famous
poem about the Reaper Death. When a person&rsquo;s beard is very
thick, we say in England to-day &ldquo;a full beard,&rdquo; but in
the time of Shakespeare they used to say &ldquo;a well filled
beard&rdquo;&mdash;hence the phrase in the second line of the first
stanza.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name=
"page227">[227]</a></span>In the third line the term
&ldquo;delicious tear&rdquo; means dew,&mdash;which the Greeks
called the tears of the night, and sometimes the tears of the dawn;
and the phrase &ldquo;drunk with dew&rdquo; is quite Greek&mdash;so
we may suspect that the author of this poem had been reading the
Greek Anthology. In the third line of the second stanza the word
&ldquo;poppy&rdquo; is used for sleep&mdash;a very common simile in
Elizabethan times, because from the poppy flower was extracted the
opiate which enables sick persons to sleep. The Greek authors spoke
of poppy sleep. &ldquo;And when thy poppy works,&rdquo; means, when
the essence of sleep begins to operate upon you, or more simply,
when you sleep. Perhaps the phrase about the &ldquo;carved
acorn-bed&rdquo; may puzzle you; it is borrowed from the fairy-lore
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, when fairies were said to sleep in
little beds carved out of acorn shells; the simile is used only by
way of calling the insect a fairy creature. In the second line of
the third stanza you may notice the curious expression about the
&ldquo;gilt plaits&rdquo; of the sun&rsquo;s beams. It was the
custom in those days, as it still is in these, for young girls to
plait their long hair; and the expression &ldquo;gilt plaits&rdquo;
only means braided or plaited golden hair. This is perhaps a Greek
conceit; for classic poets spoke of the golden hair of the Sun God
as illuminating the world. I have said that the poem is a little
artificial, but I think you will find it pretty, and even the

<h2>Note on the Influence of Finnish Poetry in English
Literature</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The subject of Finnish poetry ought to have a special interest
for the Japanese student, if only for the reason that Finnish
poetry comes more closely in many respects to Japanese poetry than
any other form of Western poetry. Indeed it is supposed that the
Finnish race is more akin to the Tartar races, and therefore
probably to the Japanese, than the races of Europe proper. Again,
through Longfellow, the value of Finnish poetry to English poetry
was first suggested, and I think you know that Longfellow&rsquo;s
Indian epic, &ldquo;The Song of Hiawatha,&rdquo; was modelled
entirely upon the Finnish &ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a word about the &ldquo;Kalevala,&rdquo; which has a very
interesting history. I believe you know that at the beginning of
the nineteenth century, the &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; was not known to
exist. During the first half of the century, Finnish scholars in
the University of Helsingfors (where there is now a great and
flourishing university) began to take literary interest in the
popular songs of Finland. For years the people had been singing
extraordinary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name=
"page229">[229]</a></span>songs full of a strange beauty and
weirdness quite unlike any other popular songs of Europe; and for
centuries professional singers had been wandering about the country
teaching these songs to the accompaniment of a kind of
<em>biwa</em> called Kantela. The scholars of the University began
to collect these songs from the mouths of the peasants and
musicians&mdash;at first with great difficulty, afterwards with
much success. The difficulty was a very curious one. In Finland the
ancient pagan religion had really never died; the songs of the
peasants were full of allusions to the old faith and the old gods,
and the orthodox church had often attempted in vain to prevent the
singing of these songs, because they were not Christian. So the
peasants at first thought that the scholars who wanted to copy the
songs were government spies or church spies who wanted evidence to
justify punishments. When the fears of the people had been removed
and when they came to understand that the questioners were only
scholars interested in literary beauty, all the secret stores of
songs were generously opened, and an immense collection of oral
literature was amassed in the University at Helsingfors.</p>
<p>The greatest of the scholars engaged in the subsequent work of
arranging and classifying was Doctor L&ouml;nnrot. While examining
the manuscript of these poems he was struck by the fact that, put
together in a particular order, they naturally <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230">[230]</a></span>made one
great continuous story or epic. Was it possible that the Finnish
people had had during all these centuries an epic unknown to the
world of literature? Many persons would have ridiculed the idea.
But L&ouml;nnrot followed up that idea, and after some years&rsquo;
study he disengaged from all that mass of song something in the
shape of a wonderful epic, the epic of the &ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo;
L&ouml;nnrot was probably, almost certainly, the only one who had
even understood the idea of an epic of this kind. The peasants did
not know. They only had the fragments of the whole; parts of the
poem existed in one province, parts in another; no Finnish musician
had ever known the whole. The whole may have been made first by
L&ouml;nnrot. At all events he was the Homer of the
&ldquo;Kalevala,&rdquo; and it was fortunate for Finland that he
happened to be himself both a scholar and a
poet&mdash;qualifications seldom united in the same person.</p>
<p>What is the &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; as we now possess it? It is
an epic, but not like any other epic in the world, for the subject
of it is Magic. We might call it the Epic of Magic. It is the story
of how the world and the heaven and the sun and the moon and the
stars, the elements and the races of living creatures and all other
things were created by magic; also how the first inhabitants of the
world lived, and loved, and fought. But there is another thing to
be said in a general was about <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page231" name="page231">[231]</a></span>this magic. The magic of
&ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; is not like anything else known by that name
in European literature. The magic of &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; is
entirely the magic of words. These ancient people believed in the
existence of words, by the utterance of which anything might be
accomplished. Instead of buying wood and hiring carpenters, you
might build a house by uttering certain magical words. If you had
no horse and wanted to travel rapidly, you could make a horse for
yourself out of bits of bark and old sticks by uttering over them
certain magical words. But this was not all. Beings of intellect,
men and women, whole armies of men, in fact, might be created in a
moment by the utterance of these mystical words. There is the real
subject of the &ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told you that the epic is not like anything else in European
literature and not like anything else in the world as to the
subject. But this is not the case as regards the verse. The verse
is not like Japanese verse, indeed, but it comes nearer to it than
any other European verse does. Of course even in Finnish verse,
accents mean a great deal, and accent means nothing at all in
Japanese verse. But I imagine something very much like Finnish
verse might be written in Japanese, provided that in reciting it a
slight stress is thrown on certain syllables. Of course you know
something about Longfellow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hiawatha&rdquo;&mdash;such lines as these:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name=
"page232">[232]</a></span>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And the evening sun descending</p>
<p>Set the clouds on fire with redness,</p>
<p>Burned the broad sky like a prairie,</p>
<p>Left upon the level water</p>
<p>One long track and trail of splendour,</p>
<p>Down whose stream, as down a river,</p>
<p>Westward, westward Hiawatha</p>
<p>Sailed into the fiery sunset,</p>
<p>Sailed into the purple vapours,</p>
<p>Sailed into the dusk of evening.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You will observe this is verse of eight syllables with four
trochees to a line. Now it is perhaps as near to Finnish verse as
English verse can be made. But the Finnish verse is more musical,
and it is much more flexible, and the rules of it can be better
carried out than in English. There is much more to be thought about
than the placing of four trochaic feet to a line. Not only must the
verse be trochaic, it must also be alliterative, and it must also
be, to some extent, rhymed verse&mdash;a matter which Longfellow
did not take into consideration. That would have doubled his
difficulty. To make verse trochaic, alliterative and rhymed, is
very difficult indeed&mdash;that is, to do it well. Only one
liberty is allowed; it is not necessary that the rhyme shall be
regular and constant; it is necessary only that it should be
occasional. But the interest of Finnish verse does not end here. I
have not yet mentioned the most important law of Finnish
poetry&mdash;the law of parallelism <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page233" name="page233">[233]</a></span>or repetition. Parallelism
is the better word. It means the repetition of a thought in a
slightly modified way. It is parallelism especially that makes so
splendid the English translation of the Bible, and the majesty of
such passages in the Book of Common Prayer as the Funeral Service.
So that Finnish poetry is anything but very simple. We may now sum
it up thus&mdash;trochaic verse of eight syllables, with
alliteration and rhyme, a caesura in the same part of every line,
and every line reiterated in parallelism.</p>
<p>A little above I mentioned the English of the Bible. Long ago I
explained why that English is so beautiful and so strong. But
remember that much of the best of the Bible, in the original
Hebrew, was not prose but verse, and that the fine effects have
been produced by translating the verse into musical prose. The very
effect can be produced by translating the &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo;
into prose. Occasionally the passages are of surprising beauty, and
they are always of surprising strangeness.</p>
<p>It is in parallelism especially that Finnish poetry offers a
contrast to Japanese, but there is no reason whatever why, in the
longer poems of Japanese poetry, parallelism could not be used. All
things have value according to place and time, and this has
value&mdash;provided that it has a special effect on a special
occasion. All through the &ldquo;Kalevala,&rdquo; all through five
hundred pages, large <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name=
"page234">[234]</a></span>pages, the parallelism is carried on, and
yet one never gets tired. It is not monotonous. But that is because
the subject is so well adapted to this form of poetry. See how the
poem opens, when the poet begins to talk about what he is going to
sing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anciently my father sang me these words in hewing the
handle of his ax; anciently my mother taught me these words as she
turned her spindle. In that time I was only a child, a little child
at the breast,&mdash;a useless little being creeping upon the floor
at the feet of its nurse, its cheek bedaubed with milk. And there
are other words which I drew from the spring of knowledge, which I
found by the wayside, which I snatched from the heart of the
thickets, which I detached from the branches of the trees, which I
gathered at the edges of the pastures&mdash;when, In my infancy, I
used to go to guard the flocks, in the midst of the honey-streaming
meadows, upon the gold-shining hills, behind the black Murikki,
behind the spotted Kimmo, my favourite cows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also the cold sang the songs, the rain sang me verses,
the winds of heaven, the waves of the sea made me hear their poems,
the birds instructed me with their melodies, the long-haired trees
invited me to their concerts. And all the songs I gathered
together, I rolled them up in a skin, I carried them away in my
beautiful little holiday <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235"
name="page235">[235]</a></span>sledge, I deposited them in the
bottom of a chest of brass, upon the highest shelf of my treasure
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when a poem opens that way we may be sure that there are
great things in it; and some of these great things we shall read
about presently. The &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; is full of wonderful
stories, But in the above quotation, I want you to see how multiple
it is, and yet it is beautiful. Now there is a very interesting
thing yet to tell you about this parallelism. Such poems as those
of the &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; have always to be sung not by one
singer but by two. The two singers straddle a bench facing each
other and hold each other&rsquo;s hands. Then they sing
alternately, each chanting one line, rocking back and forward,
pulling each other to and fro as they sing&mdash;so that it is like
the motion of rowing. One chants a line and pulls backward, then
the other chants the next line and pulls in the opposite direction.
Not to be able to answer at once would be considered a great
disgrace; and every singer has to be able to improvise as well as
to sing. And that is the signification of the following verse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put thy hand to my hand&mdash;place thy fingers between
my fingers&mdash;that we may sing of the things which
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most beautiful story in this wonderful book is the story of
Kullervo. It was after reading this <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page236" name="page236">[236]</a></span>story that Longfellow
imagined his story of the Strong Man Kwasind. Kullervo is born so
strong that as an infant he breaks his cradle to pieces, and as a
boy he can not do any work, for all the tools and instruments break
in his grasp. Therefore he gives a great deal of trouble at home
and has to go out into the world to seek his fortune. In the world,
of course, he has just the same trouble; for nobody will employ him
very long. However, the story of Kullervo&rsquo;s feats of
strength, though interesting, need not now concern us. The great
charm of this composition is in the description of a mother&rsquo;s
love which it contains. Kullervo brought misfortune everywhere
simply by his strength and by his great passions&mdash;at last
committing a terrible crime, causing the death of his own sister,
whom he does not recognize. He goes back home in desperation and
remorse; and there everybody regards him with horror, except only
his mother. She alone tries to console him; she alone tells him
that repentance may bring him rest. He then proposes to go away and
amend his wrong-doing in solitude. But first he bids them all
goodbye, and the episode is characteristic.</p>
<p>Kullervo, the son of Kalervo, gets him ready to depart; he goes
to his old father and says: &ldquo;Farewell now, O my dear father.
Wilt thou regret me bitterly, when thou shalt learn that I am
dead?&mdash;that I have disappeared from among the multitude of the
living?&mdash;that I no longer am <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page237" name="page237">[237]</a></span>one of the members of thy
family?&rdquo; The father answered: &ldquo;No, certainly I will not
regret thee when I shall hear that thou art dead. Another son
perchance will be born to me&mdash;a son who will grow up better
and wiser than thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kullervo, son of Kalervo, answered: &ldquo;And I also will not
be sorry if I hear that thou art dead. Without any trouble I can
find me such a father as thou&mdash;a stone-hearted father, a
clay-mouthed father, a berry-eyed father, a straw-bearded father, a
father whose feet are made of the roots of the willow tree, a
father whose flesh is decaying wood.&rdquo; Why does Kullervo use
these extraordinary terms? It is a reference to magic&mdash;out of
stone and clay and straw, a phantom man can be made, and Kullervo
means to say that his father is no more to him than a phantom
father, an unreal father, a father who has no fatherly feeling. His
brothers and sisters all questioned in turn if they will be sorry
to hear that he is dead, make the same cruel answer; and he replies
to them with the same angry words. But it is very different when he
speaks to his mother.</p>
<p>For to his mother he said&mdash;&ldquo;Oh my sweet mother, my
beautiful nurse, my loved protectress, wilt thou regret me bitterly
when thou shalt learn that I am dead, that I have disappeared from
the multitude of the living, that I am no longer one of the members
of thy family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother made answer: &ldquo;Thou does not <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238">[238]</a></span>comprehend
the soul of the mother&mdash;thou canst not understand the heart of
the mother. Assuredly will I regret thee most bitterly when I shall
learn that thou art dead, that thou hast disappeared, from among
the multitude of the living, that thou hast ceased to be one of the
members of my family. Floods of tears shall I weep in my chamber.
The waves of tears will overflow on the floor. And upon the
stairway lamentably shall I weep; and in the stable loudly shall I
sorrow. Upon the icy ways the snow shall melt under my
tears&mdash;under my tears the earth of the roads shall melt away;
under my tears new meadow grass shall grow up, green sprouting, and
through that grass little streams shall murmur away.&rdquo; To this
mother, naturally, Kullervo says no unkind words. He goes away,
able at least to feel that there is one person in the world who
loves him and one person in the world whom he loves. But how much
his mother really loves him he does not yet know; he will know that
later&mdash;it forms the most beautiful part of the poem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kullervo directed his steps once more to the home of his
fathers. Desolate he found it, desolate and deserted; no person
advanced to salute him, no person came to press his hand, to give
him welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He drew near to the hearth: the embers were extinguished.
By that he knew that his mother had ceased to be.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name=
"page239">[239]</a></span>&rdquo;He drew near to the fire-place,
and the stones of the fire-place were cold. By that he knew that
his father had ceased to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned his eyes upon the floor of his home; the planks
of the floor were covered with dirt and rubbish. By that he knew
that his sister had ceased to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the shore of the sea he went; the boat that used to be
there was there no longer. By that he knew that his brother had
ceased to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he began to weep. For a whole day he wept, for two
whole days he wept; then he cried aloud: &lsquo;O my mother, O my
sweet mother, what didst thou leave thy son yet in the world? Alas!
now thou canst hear me no longer; and it is in vain that I stand
above thy tomb, that I sob over the place of thine eyebrows, over
the place of thy temples; it is in vain that I cry out my grief
above thy dead forehead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother of Kullervo awakened in her tomb, and out of
the depth of the dust she spake to him: &lsquo;I have left the dog
Mastif, in order that thou mayst go with him to the chase. Take
therefore the faithful dog, and go with him into the wild forest,
into the dark wilderness, even to the dwelling place, far away, of
the blue-robed Virgins of the wood, and there thou wilt seek thy
nourishment, thou wilt ask for the game that is necessary to thy
existence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was believed that there was a particular forest <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240">[240]</a></span>god, who
protected the trees and the wild things of the wood. The hunter
could be successful in the chase only upon condition of obtaining
his favour and permission to hunt. This explains the reference to
the abode of the forest god. But Kullervo can not go far; his
remorse takes him by the throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kullervo, son of Kalervo, took his faithful dog, and
directed his steps toward the wild forest, toward the dark
wilderness. But when he had gone only a little way he found himself
at the very place where he had outraged the young girl, where he
had dishonoured the child of his mother. And all things there
mourned for her&mdash;all things; the soft grass and the tender
foliage, and the little plants, and the sorrowful briars. The grass
was no longer green, the briars no longer blossomed, the leaves and
the plants hung withered and dry about the spot where the virgin
had been dishonoured, where the brother had dishonoured his
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kullervo drew forth his sword, his sharpedged sword; a
long time he looked at it, turning it in his hand, and asking it
whether it would feel no pleasure in eating the flesh of the man
thus loaded with infamy, in drinking the blood of the man thus
covered with crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sword knew the heart of the man: it understood
the question of the hero. And it made answer to him saying:
&lsquo;Why indeed should I not <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page241" name="page241">[241]</a></span>gladly devour the flesh of
the man who is loaded with infamy? Why indeed should I not drink
with pleasure the blood of the man who is burdened with crime? For
well I devoured even the flesh of the innocent man, well can I
drink even the blood of the man who is free from crime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Kullervo fixed his sword in the earth, with the
handle downwards and the point upwards, and he threw himself upon
the point, and the point passed through all the depth of his
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the end of all, this was the cruel destiny of
Kullervo, the irrevocable end of the son of the heroes&mdash;the
death of the &lsquo;Man of Misfortune.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can see how very much unlike other Western poetry this
poetry is. The imagination indeed is of another race and another
time than those to whose literary productions we have become
accustomed. But there is beauty here; and the strangeness of it
indicates a possible literary value by which any literature may be
more or less enriched. Many are the particular episodes which rival
the beauty and strangeness of the episode of Kullervo; and I wish
that we could have time to quote them. But I can only refer to
them. There is, for example, the legend of the invention of music,
when the hero Wainamoinen (supposed to represent the Spirit of the
Wind, and the sound of the name indicates the wailing of the wind)
invents <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name=
"page242">[242]</a></span>the first musical instrument. In no other
literature is there anything quite like this except in the Greek
story of Orpheus. Even as the trees bent down their heads to listen
to the song of Orpheus, and as the wild beasts became tamed at the
sound, and as the very stones of the road followed to the steps of
the musician, so is it in the &ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo; But the
Finnish Orpheus is the greater magician. To hear him, the sun and
moon come nearer to the earth, the waves of the sea stop short,
bending their heads; the cataracts of the rivers hang motionless
and silent; the fish raise their heads above the water. And when he
plays a sad melody, all nature weeps with him, even the trees and
the stones and the little plants by the wayside. And his own tears
in falling become splendid pearls for the crowns of kings.</p>
<p>Then very wonderful too is the story of the eternal smith,
Ilmarinen, who forged the foundations of the world, forged the
mountains, forged the blue sky, so well forging them that nowhere
can be seen the marks of the pincer, the marks of the hammer, the
heads of the nails. Working in his smithy we see him all grime and
black; upon his head there is one yard deep of iron firing, upon
his shoulders there is one fathom deep of soot&mdash;the soot of
the forge; for he seldom has time to bathe himself. But when the
notion takes him to get married, for the first time he bathes
himself, and dresses himself handsomely, then he becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name=
"page243">[243]</a></span>the most beautiful of men. In order to
win his wife he is obliged to perform miracles of work; yet after
he wins her she is killed by wild beasts. Then he sets to work to
forge himself a wife, a wife of silver, a bride of gold. Very
beautiful she is, but she has no heart, and she is always cold, and
there is no comfort in her; even all the magic of the world-maker
can not give her a warm heart. But the work is so beautiful that he
does not like to destroy it. So he takes the wife of silver, the
bride of gold, to the wisest of heroes, Wainamoinen, and offers her
to him as a gift. But the hero will have no such gift, &ldquo;Throw
her back into your forged fire, O Ilmarinen,&rdquo; the hero makes
answer&mdash;&ldquo;What greater folly, what greater sorrow can
come upon man than to love a wife of silver, a bride of
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pretty story needs no explanation; the moral is simply
&ldquo;Never marry for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there is the story of Lemminkainen (this personality
suggested the Pau-puk-keewis of Longfellow)&mdash;the joyous,
reckless, handsome, mischievous pleasure-lover,&mdash;always
falling into trouble, because he will not follow his mother&rsquo;s
advice, but always loved by her in spite of his follies. The mother
of Lemminkainen is a more wonderful person than the mother of
Kullervo. Her son has been murdered, thrown into a river&mdash;the
deepest of all rivers, the river of the dead, the river of hell.
And his mother goes out to find <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page244" name="page244">[244]</a></span>him. She asks the trees in
the forest to tell her where her son is, and she obliges them to
answer. But they do not know. She asks the grass, the plants, the
animals, the birds; she obliges even the road upon which he walked
to talk to her, she talks to the stars and the moon and the sun.
Only the sun knows, because he sees everything and he answers,
&ldquo;Your son is dead, torn to pieces; he has been thrown into
the river of Tuoni, the river of hell, the river of the
dead.&rdquo; But the mother does not despair. Umarinen, the eternal
smith, must make for her a rake of brass with teeth long enough to
reach into the world of the dead, into the bottom of the abyss; and
out of the abyss she brings up the parts of the torn body of her
son; she puts them together; she sings over them a magic song; she
brings her son to life again, and takes him home. But for a long
time he is not able to remember, because he has been dead. After a
long time he gets back his memory&mdash;only to get into new
mischief out of which his mother must help him afresh.</p>
<p>The names of the three heroes quoted to you represent also the
names of three great stories, out of the many stories contained in
the epics. But in this epic, as in the Indian epics (I mean the
Sanskrit epic), there is much more than stories. There are also
chapters of moral instruction of a very curious kind&mdash;chapters
about conduct, the conduct of the parents, the conduct of the
children, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name=
"page245">[245]</a></span>the conduct of the husband, the conduct
of the bride. The instructions to the bride are contained in the
twenty-third Rune; there are altogether fifty Runes in the book.
This appears to me likely to interest you, for it is written in
relation to a family system not at all like the family system of
the rest of Europe. I think you will find in it not a little that
may remind you of Chinese teaching on the same subject&mdash;the
conduct of the daughter-in-law. But there are of course many
differences, and the most pleasing difference is the tone of great
tenderness in which the instructions are given. Let us quote some
of them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O young bride, O my young sister, O my well beloved and
beautiful young flower, listen to the words which I am going to
speak to you, harken to the lesson which I am going to teach you.
You are going now very far away from us, O beautiful
flower!&mdash;you are going to take a long journey, O my
wild-strawberry fruit! you are about to fly away from us, O most
delicate down! you are about to leave us forever, O velvet
tissue&mdash;far away from this habitation you must go, far away
from this beautiful house, to enter another house, to enter into a
strange family. And in that strange house your position will be
very different. There you will have to walk about with care, to
conduct yourself with prudence, to conduct yourself with
thoughtfulness. There you will not be able, as in the house of your
father, as in the dwelling of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246"
name="page246">[246]</a></span>your mother, to run about where you
please, to run singing through the valleys, to warhle out your
songs upon the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New habits you must now learn, and forget all the old.
You must abandon the love of your father and content yourself with
the love of your father-in-law; you must bow very low, you must
learn to be generous in the use of courteous words. You must give
up old habits and form new ones; you must resign the love of your
mother and content yourself with the love of your step-mother:
lower must you bow, and you must learn to be lavish in the use of
kindly words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New habits you must learn and forget the old: you must
leave behind you the friendship of your brother, and content
yourself with the friendship of your brother-in-law; you must bow
lower than you do now; you must learn to be lavish of kindly
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New habits you must acquire and forget the old ones; you
must leave behind you the friendship of your sister, and be
satisfied with the friendship of your sister-in-law; you must learn
to make humble reverence, to bow low, to be generous in kindly
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the old man in the corner be to you even like a wolf,
if the old woman in her corner be to you even as a she-bear in the
house, if the brother-in-law be to you even as a serpent upon the
threshold, if the sister-in-law be to you even as a sharp nail,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name=
"page247">[247]</a></span>none the less you must show them each and
all exactly the same respect and the same obedience that you have
been accustomed to display to your father, to display to your
mother, under the roof of your childhood home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows a really terrible list of the duties that she must
perform every day from early morning until late at night; to
mention them all would take too long. I quote only a few, enough to
show that the position of a Finnish wife was by no means an easy
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon as the cock crows in the morning you must be
quick to rise; you must keep your ears awake to hear the cry of the
cock. And if there be no cock, or the cock does not crow, then let
the moon be as a cock for you, let the constellation of the great
Bear tell you when it is time to rise. Then you must quickly make
the fire, skilfully removing the ashes, without sprinkling them
upon the floor. Then quickly go to the stable, clean the stable,
take food to the cattle, feed all the animals on the farm. For
already the cow of your mother-in-law will be lowing for food; the
horse of your father-in-law will be whinnying; the milch cow of
your sister-in-law will be straining at her tether; the calf of
your brother-in-law will be bleating; for all will be waiting for
her whose duty it is to give them hay, whose duty it is to give
them food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like instructions are given about feeding the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248">[248]</a></span>younger
animals and the fowls and the little pigs. But she must not forget
the children of the house at the same time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have fed the animals and cleaned the stables
come back quickly, quickly as a snow-storm. For in the chamber the
little child has awakened and has begun to cry in his cradle. He
cannot speak, poor little one; he cannot tell you, if he be hungry
or if he be cold, or if anything extraordinary has happened to him,
before someone that he knows has come to care for him, before he
hears the voice of his own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After enumerating and inculcating in the same manner all the
duties of the day, the conduct to be observed toward every member
of the family&mdash;father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister, and
brother-in-law, and the children of them&mdash;we find a very
minute code of conduct set forth in regard to neighbours and
acquaintances. The young wife is especially warned against gossip,
against listening to any stories about what happens in other
people&rsquo;s houses, and against telling anybody what goes on
within her own. One piece of advice is memorable. If the young wife
is asked whether she is well fed, she should reply always that she
has the best of everything which a house can afford, this even if
she should have been left without any proper nourishment for
several days. Evidently the condition of submission to which
Finnish women were reduced by custom was something <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249">[249]</a></span>much less
merciful than has ever been known in Eastern countries. Only a very
generous nature could bear such discipline; and we have many
glimpses in the poem of charming natures of this kind.</p>
<p>You have seen that merely as a collection of wonderful stories
the Kalevala is of extraordinary interest, that it is also of
interest as describing the social ethics of a little known
people&mdash;finally that it is of interest, of very remarkable
interest, merely as natural poetry&mdash;poetry treating of wild
nature, especially rivers and forests and mountains, of the life of
the fisher and hunter and wood-cutter. Indeed, so far as this kind
of poetry is concerned, the &ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; stands alone
among the older productions of European poetry. You do not find
this love of nature in Scandinavian poetry, nor in Anglo-Saxon
poetry, nor in old German poetry, much less in the earlier form of
French, Italian, or Spanish poetry. The old Northern poetry comes
nearest to it; for in Anglo-Saxon composition we can find at least
wonderful descriptions of the sea, of stones, of the hard life of
sailors. But the dominant tone in Northern poetry is war; it is in
descriptions of battle, or in accounts of the death of heroes, that
the ancient English or ancient Scandinavian poets excelled In
Finnish poetry, on the other hand, there is little or nothing about
war. These peaceful people never had any warlike history; their
life was agricultural <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name=
"page250">[250]</a></span>for the most part, with little or no
violence except such as the excitement of hunting and fishing could
produce. Therefore they had plenty of time to think about nature,
to love nature and to describe it as no other people of the same
period described it. Striking comparisons have been made between
the Anglo-Saxon Runes, or charm songs, and Finnish songs of the
same kind, which fully illustrate this difference. Like the Finns,
the early English had magical songs to the gods of
nature&mdash;songs for the healing of wounds and the banishing of
sickness. But these are very commonplace. Not one of them can
compare as poetry with the verses of the Finnish on the same
subject. Here are examples in evidence. The first is a prayer said
when offering food to the Spirit of the forest, that he might aid
the hunter in his hunting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, O Kuntar, a fat cake, a cake with honey, that I may
propitiate the forest, that I may propitiate the forest, that I may
entice the thick forest for the day of my hunting, when I go in
search of prey. Accept my salt, O wood, accept my porridge, O
Tapio, dear king of the wood with the hat of leaves, with the beard
of moss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here is a little prayer to the goddess of water repeated by
a sick man taking water as a medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O pure water, O Lady of the Water, now do thou make me
whole, lovely as before! for this <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page251" name="page251">[251]</a></span>beg thee dearly, and in
offering I give thee blood to appease thee, salt to propitiate
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goddess of the Sea, mistress of waters, Queen of a
hundred caves, arouse the scaly flocks, urge on the fishy-crowds
forth from their hiding places, forth from the muddy shrine, forth
from the net-hauling, to the nets of a hundred fishers! Take now
thy beauteous shield, shake the golden water, with which thou
frightenest the fish, and direct them toward the net beneath the
dark level, above the borders black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O vigorous mistress of the wild beasts, sweet lady of the
earth, come with me, be with me, where I go. Come thou and good
luck bring me, to happy fortune help me. Make thou to move the
foliage, the fruit tree to be shaken, and the wild beasts drive
thither, the largest and the smallest, with their snouts of every
kind, with their paws of fur of all kinds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when you look at these little prayers, when you read them
over and observe how pretty they are, you will also observe that
they make little pictures in the mind. Can not you see the fish
gliding over the black border under the dark level of the water, to
the net of a hundred fishers? Can you not see the &ldquo;dear king
of the wood,&rdquo; with his hat of leaves and his beard of moss?
Can you not also see in imagination the wild creatures of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name=
"page252">[252]</a></span>the forest with their snouts of many
shapes, with their fur of all kinds? But in Anglo-Saxon poetry you
will not find anything like that. Anglo-Saxon Rune songs create no
images. It is this picturesqueness, this actuality of imagery that
is distinctive in Finnish poetry.</p>
<p>In the foregoing part of the lecture I have chiefly tried to
interest you in the &ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo; But aside from
interesting you in the book itself as a story, as a poem, I hope to
direct your attention to a particular feature in Finnish poetry
which is most remote from Japanese poetry. I have spoken of
resemblances as to structure and method; but it is just in that
part of the method most opposed to Japanese tradition that the
greatest interest lies. I do not mean only the use of natural
imagery; I mean much more the use of parallelism to reinforce that
imagery. That is the thing especially worthy of literary study.
Indeed, I think that such study might greatly help towards a new
development, a totally new departure in Japanese verse. In another
lecture I spoke as sincerely as I could of the very high merit in
the epigrammatic forms of Japanese poetry. These brief forms of
poetry have been developed in Japan to perfection not equalled
elsewhere in modern poetry, perhaps not surpassed, in some
respects, even by Greek poetry of the same kind. But there can be
no doubt of this fact, that a national literature requires many
other forms of expression <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253"
name="page253">[253]</a></span>than the epigrammatic form. Nothing
that is good should ever be despised or cast aside; but because of
its excellences, we should not be blind to the possibility of other
excellences. Now Japanese literature has other forms of
poetry&mdash;forms in which it is possible to produce poems of
immense length, but the spirit of epigrammatic poetry has really
been controlling even these to a great degree.</p>
<p>I mean that so far as I am able to understand the subject, the
tendency of all Japanese poetry is to terse expression. Were it not
well therefore to consider at least the possible result of a
totally opposite tendency,&mdash;expansion of fancy, luxuriance of
expression? Terseness of expression, pithiness, condensation, are
of vast importance in prose, but poetry has other methods, and the
&ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; is one of the best possible object lessons
in the study of such methods, because of the very simplicity and
naturalness with which they are followed.</p>
<p>Of course there was parallelism in Western poetry, and all arts
of repetition, before anybody knew anything about the
&ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo; The most poetical part of Bible English, as
I said, whether in the Bible itself or in the Book of Common
Prayer, depends almost entirely for its literary effect upon
parallelism, because the old Hebrews, like the old Finns, practised
this art of expression. Loosely and vaguely it was practised also
by many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name=
"page254">[254]</a></span>poets almost unconsciously, who had been
particularly influenced by the splendour of the scriptural
translation. It had figured in prose-poetry as early as the time of
Sir Thomas Browne. It had established quite a new idea of poetry
even in America, where the great American poet Poe introduced it
into his compositions before Longfellow studied the
&ldquo;Kalevala.&rdquo; I told you that the work of Poe, small as
it is, had influenced almost every poet of the great epoch,
including Tennyson and the Victorian masters. But the work even of
Poe was rather instinctive than the result of any systematic idea.
The systematic idea was best illustrated when the study of the
&ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; began.</p>
<p>Let us see how Longfellow used the suggestion; but remember that
he was only a beginner, dealing with something entirely
new&mdash;that he did not have the strength of Tennyson nor the
magical genius of Swinburne to help him. He worked very simply, and
probably very rapidly. There is a good deal of his song of
&ldquo;Hiawatha&rdquo; that is scarcely worthy of praise, and it is
difficult to quote effectively from it, because the charm of the
thing depends chiefly upon its reading as a whole. Nevertheless
there are parts which so well show or imitate the Finnish spirit,
that I must try to quote them. Take for instance the teaching of
the little Indian child by his grandmother&mdash;such <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255">[255]</a></span>verses as
these, where she talks to the little boy about the milky way in the
sky:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Many things Nokomis taught him</p>
<p>Of the stars that shine in heaven;</p>
<p>Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,</p>
<p>Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;</p>
<p>Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,</p>
<p>Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,</p>
<p>Flaring far away to northward</p>
<p>In the frosty nights of Winter;</p>
<p>Showed the broad, white road in heaven,</p>
<p>Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,</p>
<p>Running straight across the heavens,</p>
<p>Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or take again the story of the origin of the flower commonly
called &ldquo;Dandelion&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In his life he had one shadow,</p>
<p>In his heart one sorrow had he.</p>
<p>Once, as he was gazing northward,</p>
<p>Far away upon a prairie</p>
<p>He beheld a maiden standing,</p>
<p>Saw a tall and slender maiden</p>
<p>All alone upon a prairie;</p>
<p>Brightest green were all her garments</p>
<p>And her hair was like the sunshine.</p>
<p>Day by day he gazed upon her,</p>
<p>Day by day he sighed with passion,</p>
<p>Day by day his heart within him</p>
<p>Grew more hot with love and longing</p>
<p>For the maid with yellow tresses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name=
"page256">[256]</a></span>Observe how the repetition served to
represent the growing of the lover&rsquo;s admiration. The same
repetition can be used much more effectively in describing
weariness and pain, as In the lines about the winter famine:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, the long and dreary Winter!</p>
<p>Oh, the cold and cruel Winter!</p>
<p>Ever thicker, thicker, thicker</p>
<p>Froze the ice on lake and river,</p>
<p>Ever deeper, deeper, deeper</p>
<p>Fell the snow o&rsquo;er all the landscape,</p>
<p>Fell the covering snow, and drifted</p>
<p>Through the forest, round the village.</p>
<p>Hardly from his buried wigwam</p>
<p>Could the hunter force a passage;</p>
<p>With his mittens and his snow-shoes</p>
<p>Vainly walked he through the forest,</p>
<p>Sought for bird or beast and found none,</p>
<p>Saw no track of deer or rabbit,</p>
<p>In the snow beheld no footprints,</p>
<p>In the ghastly, gleaming forest</p>
<p>Fell, and could not rise from weakness,</p>
<p>Perished there from cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Oh, the famine and the fever!</p>
<p>Oh, the wasting of the famine!</p>
<p>Oh, the blasting of the fever!</p>
<p>Oh, the wailing of the children!</p>
<p>Oh, the anguish of the women!</p>
<p>All the earth was sick and famished;</p>
<p>Hungry was the air around them,</p>
<p>Hungry was the sky above them,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name=
"page257">[257]</a></span>
<p>And the hungry stars in heaven</p>
<p>Like the eyes of wolves glared at them!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is strong, emotionally strong, though it is not great
poetry; but it makes the emotional effect of great poetry by the
use of the same means which the Finnish poets used. The best part
of the poem is the famine chapter, and the next best is the part
entitled &ldquo;The Ghosts.&rdquo; However, the charm of a
composition can be fully felt only by those who understand
something of the American Indian&rsquo;s life and the wild
northwestern country described. That is not the immediate matter to
be considered, notwithstanding. The matter to be considered is
whether this method of using parallelism and repetition and
alliteration can give new and great results. I believe that it can,
and that a greater Longfellow would have brought such results into
existence long ago. Of course, the form is primitive; it does not
follow that an English poet or a Japanese poet should attempt only
a return to primitive methods of poetry in detail. The detail is of
small moment; the spirit is everything. Parallelism means simply
the wish to present the same idea under a variety of aspects,
instead of attempting to put it forward in one aspect only.
Everything great in the way of thought, everything beautiful in the
way of idea, has many sides. It is merely the superficial which we
can see from the front only; the solid can be perceived from every
possible direction, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name=
"page258">[258]</a></span>and changes shape according to the
direction looked at.</p>
<p>The great master of English verse, Swinburne is also a poet much
given to parallelism; for he has found it of incomparable use to
him in managing new forms of verse. He uses it in an immense
variety of ways&mdash;ways impossible to Japanese poets or to
Finnish poets; and the splendour of the results can not be imitated
in another language. But his case is interesting. The most
primitive methods of Finnish poetry, and of ancient poetry in
general, coming into his hands, are reproduced into music. I
propose to make a few quotations, in illustration. Here are some
lines from &ldquo;Atalanta in Calydon&rdquo;; they are only
parallelisms, but how magnificent they are!</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When thou dravest the men</p>
<p class="i2">Of the chosen of Thrace,</p>
<p>None turned him again,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor endured he thy face</p>
<p>Close round with the blush of the battle, with light from a
terrible place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Look again at the following lines from &ldquo;A Song in Time of
Revolution&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>There is none of them all that is whole; their lips gape open
for breath;</p>
<p>They are clothed with sickness of soul, and the shape of the
shadow of death.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name=
"page259">[259]</a></span>
<p>The wind is thwart in their feet; it is full of the shouting of
mirth;</p>
<p>As one shaketh the sides of a sheet, so it shaketh the ends of
the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sword, the sword is made keen; the iron has opened its
mouth;</p>
<p>The corn is red that was green; it is bound for the sheaves of
the south.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sound of a word was shed, the sound of the wind as a
breath,</p>
<p>In the ears of the souls that were dead, in the dust of the
deepness of death.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where the face of the moon is taken, the ways of the stars
undone,</p>
<p>The light of the whole sky shaken, the light of the face of the
sun.</p>
</div>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where the sword was covered and hidden, and dust had grown in
its side,</p>
<p>A word came forth which was bidden, the crying of one that
cried:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sides of the two-edged sword shall be bare, and its mouth
shall be red,</p>
<p>For the breath of the face of the Lord that is felt in the bones
of the dead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All this is indeed very grand compared with anything in the
&ldquo;Kalevala&rdquo; or in Longfellow&rsquo;s rendering; but do
you not see that the grandeur is <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page260" name="page260">[260]</a></span>also the grandeur of
parallelism? Here is proof of what a master can do with a method
older than Western civilization. But what is the inference? Is it
not that the old primitive poetry contains something of eternal
value, a value ranging from the lowest even to the highest, a value
that can lend beauty equally to the song of a little child or to
the thunder of the grandest epic verse?</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_13" name="Ch_13">Chapter XIII</a></h3>
<h2>The Most Beautiful Romance of the Middle Ages</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The value of romantic literature, which has been, so far as the
Middle Ages are concerned, unjustly depreciated, does not depend
upon beauty of words or beauty of fact. To-day the immense debt of
modern literature to the literature of the Middle Ages is better
understood; and we are generally beginning to recognize what we owe
to the imagination of the Middle Ages, in spite of the ignorance,
the superstition and the cruelty of that time. If the evils of the
Middle Ages had really been universal, those ages could not have
imparted to us lessons of beauty and lessons of nobility having
nothing to do with literary form in themselves, yet profoundly
affecting modern poetry of the highest class. No; there was very
much of moral goodness as well as of moral badness in the Middle
Ages; and what was good happened to be very good indeed. Commonly
it used to be said (though I do not think any good critic would say
it now) that the fervid faith of the time made the moral beauty.
Unless we modify <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name=
"page262">[262]</a></span>this statement a great deal, we can not
now accept it at all. There was indeed a religious beauty,
particularly medi&aelig;val, but it was not that which created the
romance of the period. Indeed, that romantic literature was
something of a reaction against the religious restraint upon
imagination. But if we mean by medi&aelig;val faith only that which
is very much older than any European civilization, and which does
not belong to the West any more than to the East&mdash;the profound
belief in human moral experience&mdash;then I think that the
statement is true enough. At no time in European history were men
more sincere believers in the value of certain virtues than during
the Middle Ages&mdash;and the very best of the romances are just
those romances which illustrate that belief, though not written for
a merely ethical purpose.</p>
<p>But I can not better illustrate what I mean than by telling a
story, which has nothing to do with Europe, or the Middle Ages, or
any particular form of religious belief. It is not a Christian
story at all; and it could not be told you exactly as written, for
there are some very curious pages in it. But it is a good example
of the worth that may lie in a mere product of imagination.</p>
<p>There was a king once, in Persia or Arabia, who, at the time of
his accession to power, discovered a wonderful subterranean hall
under the garden of his palace. In one chamber of that hall stood
six marvellous statues of young girls, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page263" name="page263">[263]</a></span>each statue being made out
of a single diamond. The beauty as well as the cost of the work was
beyond imagination. But in the midst of the statues, which stood in
a circle, there was an empty pedestal, and on that pedestal was a
precious casket containing a letter from the dead father of the
king. The letter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my son, though these statues of girls are indeed beyond
all praise, there is yet a seventh statue incomparably more
precious and beautiful which I could not obtain before I died. It
is now your duty, O my son, to obtain that statue, that it may be
placed upon the seventh pedestal. Go, therefore, and ask my
favourite slave, who is still alive, how you are to obtain
it.&rdquo; Then the young king went in all haste to that old slave,
who had been his father&rsquo;s confidant, and showed him the
letter. And the old man said, &ldquo;Even now, O master, I will go
with you to find that statue. But it is in one of the three islands
in which the genii dwell; and it is necessary, above all things,
that you do not fear, and that you obey my instructions in all
things. Also, remember that if you make a promise to the Spirits of
that land, the promise must be kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they proceeded upon their journey through a great
wilderness, in which &ldquo;nothing existed but grass and the
presence of God.&rdquo; I can not try now to tell you about the
wonderful things that happened to them, nor about the marvellous
boat, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name=
"page264">[264]</a></span>rowed by a boatman having upon his
shoulders the head of an elephant. Suffice it to say that at last
they reached the palace of the king of the Spirits; and the king
came to meet them in the form of a beautiful old man with a long
white beard. And he said to the young king, &ldquo;My son, I will
gladly help you, as I helped your father; and I will give you that
seventh statue of diamond which you desire. But I must ask for a
gift in return. You must bring to me here a young girl of about
sixteen years old; and she must be very intelligent; and she must
be a true maiden, not only as to her body, but as to her soul, and
heart, and all her thoughts.&rdquo; The young king thought that was
a very easy thing to find, but the king of the Spirits assured him
that it was not, and further told him this, &ldquo;My son, no
mortal man is wise enough to know by his own wisdom the purity that
is in the heart of a young girl. Only by the help of this magical
mirror, which I now lend you, will you be able to know. Look at the
reflection of any maiden in this mirror, and then, if her heart is
perfectly good and pure, the mirror will remain bright. But if
there be any fault in her, the mirror will grow dim. Go now, and do
my bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can imagine, of course, what happened next. Returning to his
kingdom, the young king had brought before him many beautiful
girls, the daughters of the noblest and highest in all the cities
of the land. But in no case did the mirror <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265">[265]</a></span>remain
perfectly clear when the ghostly test was applied. For three years
in vain the king sought; then in despair he for the first time
turned his attention to the common people. And there came before
him on the very first day a rude man of the desert, who said,
&ldquo;I know of just such a girl as you want.&rdquo; Then he went
forth and presently returned with a simple girl from the desert,
who had been brought up in the care of her father only, and had
lived with no other companion than the members of her own family
and the camels and horses of the encampment. And as she stood in
her poor dress before the king, he saw that she was much more
beautiful than any one whom he had seen before; and he questioned
her, only to find that she was very intelligent; and she was not at
all afraid or ashamed of standing before the king, but looked about
her with large wondering eyes, like the eyes of a child; and
whoever met that innocent gaze, felt a great joy in his heart, and
could not tell why. And when the king had the mirror brought, and
the reflection of the girl was thrown upon it, the mirror became
much brighter than before, and shone like a great moon.</p>
<p>There was the maid whom the Spirit-king wished for. The king
easily obtained her from her parents; but he did not tell her what
he intended to do with her. Now it was his duty to give her to the
Spirits; but there was a condition he found very hard to fulfil. By
the terms of his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name=
"page266">[266]</a></span>promise he was not allowed to kiss her,
to caress her, or even to see her, except veiled after the manner
of the country. Only by the mirror had he been able to know how
fair she was. And the voyage was long; and on the way, the girl,
who thought she was going to be this king&rsquo;s bride, became
sincerely attached to him, after the manner of a child with a
brother; and he also in his heart became much attached to her. But
it was his duty to give her up. At last they reached the palace of
the Spirit-king; and the figure of the old man came forth and said,
&ldquo;My son, you have done well and kept your promise. This
maiden is all that I could have wished for; and I accept her. Now
when you go back to your palace, you will find on the seventh
pedestal the statue of the diamond which your father desired you to
obtain.&rdquo; And, with these words, the Spirit-king vanished,
taking with him the girl, who uttered a great and piercing cry to
heaven at having been thus deceived. Very sorrowfully the young
king then began his journey home. All along the way he kept
regretting that girl, and regretting the cruelty which he had
practised in deceiving her and her parents. And he began to say to
himself, &ldquo;Accursed be the gift of the king of the Spirits! Of
what worth to me is a woman of diamond any more than a woman of
stone? What is there in all the world half so beautiful or half so
precious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name=
"page267">[267]</a></span>as a living girl such as I discovered?
Fool that I was to give her up for the sake of a statue!&rdquo; But
he tried to console himself by remembering that he had obeyed his
dead father&rsquo;s wish.</p>
<p>Still, he could not console himself. Reaching his palace, he
went to his secret chamber to weep alone, and he wept night and
day, in spite of the efforts of his ministers to comfort him. But
at last one of them said, &ldquo;O my king, in the hall beneath
your garden there has appeared a wonderful statue upon the seventh
pedestal; perchance if you go to see it, your heart will become
more joyful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with great reluctance the king properly dressed himself,
and went to the subterranean hall.</p>
<p>There indeed was the statue, the gift of the Spirit-king; and
very beautiful it was. But it was not made of diamond, and it
looked so strangely like the girl whom he had lost, that the
king&rsquo;s heart leapt in his breast for astonishment. He put out
his hand and touched the statue, and found it warm with life and
youth. And a sweet voice said to him, &ldquo;Yes, it is really
I&mdash;have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she was given back to him; and the Spirit-king came to
their wedding, and thus addressed the bridegroom, &ldquo;O my son,
for your dead father&rsquo;s sake I did this thing. For it was
meant to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name=
"page268">[268]</a></span>teach you that the worth of a really pure
and perfect woman is more than the price of any diamond or any
treasure that the earth can yield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now you can see at once the beauty of this story; and the moral
of it is exactly the same as that of the famous verse, in the Book
of Proverbs, &ldquo;Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is
far above rubies.&rdquo; But it is simply a story from the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo;&mdash;one of those stories which you
will not find in the ordinary European translations, because it is
written in such a way that no English translator except Burton
would have dared to translate it quite literally. The obscenity of
parts of the original does not really detract in the least from the
beauty and tenderness of the motive of the story; and we must
remember that what we call moral or immoral in style depends very
much upon the fashion of an age and time.</p>
<p>Now it is exactly the same kind of moral charm that
distinguishes the best of the old English romances&mdash;a charm
which has nothing to do with the style, but everything to do with
the feeling and suggestion of the composition. But in some of the
old romances, the style too has a very great charm of quaintness
and simplicity and sincerity not to be imitated to-day. In this
respect the older French romances, from which the English made
their renderings, are much the best. And the best of all is said to
be &ldquo;Amis and Amile,&rdquo; which the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269">[269]</a></span>English
rendered as &ldquo;Amicus and Amelius.&rdquo; Something of the
story ought to interest you.</p>
<p>The whole subject of this romance is the virtue of friendship,
though this of course involves a number of other virtues quite as
distinguished. Amis and Amile, that is to say Amicus and Amelius,
are two young knights who at the beginning of their career become
profoundly attached to each other. Not content with the duties of
this natural affection, they imposed upon themselves all the duties
which chivalry also attached to the office of friend. The romance
tells of how they triumphed over every conceivable test to which
their friendship was subjected. Often and often the witchcraft of
woman worked to separate them, but could not. Both married, yet
after marriage their friendship was just as strong as before. Each
has to fight many times on account of the other, and suffer all
things which it is most hard for a proud and brave man to bear. But
everything is suffered cheerfully, and the friends are such true
knights that, in all their trials, neither does anything wrong, or
commits the slightest fault against truth&mdash;until a certain sad
day. On that day it is the duty of Amis to fight in a trial by
battle. But he is sick, and can not fight; then to save his honour
his friend Amile puts on the armour and helmet of Amis, and so
pretending to be Amis, goes to the meeting place, and wins the
fight gloriously. But this was an act of untruthfulness;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name=
"page270">[270]</a></span>he had gone into battle under a false
name, and to do anything false even for a good motive is bad. So
heaven punishes him by afflicting him with the horrible disease of
leprosy.</p>
<p>The conditions of leprosy in the Middle Ages were of a peculiar
kind. The disease seems to have been introduced into Europe from
Asia&mdash;perhaps by the Crusaders. Michelet suggests that it may
have resulted from the European want of cleanliness, brought about
by ascetic teachings&mdash;for the old Greek and Roman public
bath-houses were held in horror by the medi&aelig;val Church. But
this is not at all certain. What is certain is that in the
thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries leprosy became very
prevalent. The disease was not then at all understood; it was
supposed to be extremely contagious, and the man afflicted by it
was immediately separated from society, and not allowed to live in
any community under such conditions as could bring him into contact
with other inhabitants. His wife or children could accompany him
only on the terrible condition of being considered lepers. Every
leper wore a kind of monk&rsquo;s dress, with a hood covering the
face; and he had to carry a bell and ring it constantly to give
notice of his approach. Special leper-houses were built near every
town, where such unfortunates might obtain accommodation. They were
allowed to beg, but it was considered dangerous to go very near
them, so that in most cases <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271"
name="page271">[271]</a></span>alms or food would be thrown to them
only, instead of being put into their hands.</p>
<p>Now when the victim of leprosy in this romance is first
afflicted by the disease, he happens to be far away from his good
friend. And none of his own family is willing to help him; he is
regarded with superstitious as well as with physical horror. There
is nothing left for him to do but to yield up his knighthood and
his welfare and his family, to put on the leper&rsquo;s robe, and
to go begging along the roads, carrying a leper&rsquo;s bell. And
this he does. For long, long months he goes begging from town to
town, till at last, by mere chance, he finds his way to the gate of
the great castle where his good friend is living&mdash;now a great
prince, and married to the daughter of the king. And he asks at the
castle gate for charity and for food.</p>
<p>Now the porter at the gate observes that the leper has a very
beautiful cup, exactly resembling a drinking cup belonging to his
master, and he thinks it his duty to tell these things to the lord
of the castle. And the lord of the castle remembers that very long
ago he and his friend each had a cup of this kind, given to them by
the bishop of Rome. So, hearing the porter&rsquo;s story, he knew
that the leper at the gate was the friend who &ldquo;had delivered
him from death, and won for him the daughter of the King of France
to be his wife.&rdquo; Here I had better quote from the French
version <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name=
"page272">[272]</a></span>of the story, in which the names of the
friends are changed, but without changing the beauty of the tale
itself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And straightway he fell upon him, and began to weep
greatly, and kissed him. And when his wife heard that, she ran out
with her hair in disarray, weeping and distressed
exceedingly&mdash;for she remembered that it was he who had slain
the false Ardres. And thereupon they placed him in a fair bed, and
said to him, &lsquo;Abide with us until God&rsquo;s will be
accomplished in thee, for all that we have is at thy
service.&rsquo; So he abode with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must understand, by the allusion to &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
will,&rdquo; that leprosy was in the Middle Ages really considered
to be a punishment from heaven&mdash;so that in taking a leper into
his castle, the good friend was not only offending against the law
of the land, but risking celestial punishment as well, according to
the notions of that age. His charity, therefore, was true charity
indeed, and his friendship without fear. But it was going to be put
to a test more terrible than any ever endured before. To comprehend
what followed, you must know that there was one horrible
superstition of the Middle Ages&mdash;the belief that by bathing in
human blood the disease of leprosy might be cured. Murders were
often committed under the influence of that superstition. I believe
you will remember that the &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; of
Longfellow is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name=
"page273">[273]</a></span>founded upon a medi&aelig;val story in
which a young girl voluntarily offers up her life in order that her
blood may cure the leprosy of her king. In the present romance
there is much more tragedy. One night while sleeping in his
friend&rsquo;s castle, the leper was awakened by an angel from
God&mdash;Raphael&mdash;who said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Raphael, the angel of the Lord, and I am come to
tell thee how thou mayst be healed. Thou shalt bid Amile thy
comrade that he slay his two children and wash thee in their blood,
and so thy body shall be made whole.&rdquo; And Amis said to him,
&ldquo;Let not this thing be, that my comrade should become a
murderer for my sake.&rdquo; But the angel said, &ldquo;It is
convenient that he do this.&rdquo; And thereupon the angel
departed.</p>
<p>The phrase, &ldquo;it is convenient,&rdquo; must be understood
as meaning, &ldquo;it is ordered.&rdquo; For the medi&aelig;val
lord used such gentle expressions when issuing his commands; and
the angel talked like a feudal messenger. But in spite of the
command, the sick man does not tell his friend about the
angel&rsquo;s visit, until Amile, who has overheard the voice,
forces him to acknowledge whom he had been talking with during the
night. And the emotion of the lord may be imagined, though he
utters it only in the following gentle words&mdash;&ldquo;I would
have given to thee my man servants and my maid servants and all my
goods&mdash;and thou feignest that an angel hath spoken to thee
that I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name=
"page274">[274]</a></span>should slay my two children. But I
conjure thee by the faith which there is between me and thee and by
our comradeship, and by the baptism we received together, that thou
tell me whether it was man or angel said that to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amis declares that it was really an angel, and Amile never
thinks of doubting his friend&rsquo;s word. It would be a pity to
tell you the sequel in my own words; let me quote again from the
text, translated by Walter Pater. I think you will find it
beautiful and touching:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Amile began to weep in secret, and thought within
himself, &lsquo;If this man was ready to die before the King for
me, shall I not for him slay my children? Shall I not keep faith
with him who was faithful to me even unto death?&rsquo; And Amile
tarried no longer, but departed to the chamber of his wife, and
bade her go to hear the Sacred Office. And he took a sword, and
went to the bed where the children were lying, and found them
asleep. And he lay down over them and began to weep bitterly and
said, &lsquo;Has any man yet heard of a father who of his own will
slew his children? Alas, my children! I am no longer your father,
but your cruel murderer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the children awoke at the tears of their father,
which fell upon them; and they looked up into his face and began to
laugh. And as they were of age about three years, he said,
&lsquo;Your laughing will be turned into tears, for your innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name=
"page275">[275]</a></span>blood must now be shed&rsquo;; and
therewith he cut off their heads. Then he laid them back in the
bed, and put the heads upon the bodies, and covered them as though
they slept; and with the blood which he had taken he washed his
comrade, and said, &lsquo;Lord Jesus Christ! who hast commanded men
to keep faith on earth, and didst heal the leper by Thy word!
cleanse now my comrade, for whose love I have shed the blood of my
children.&rsquo;&rdquo; And of course the leper is immediately and
completely cured. But the mother did not know anything about the
killing of the children; we have to hear something about her share
in the tragedy. Let me again quote, this time giving the real and
very beautiful conclusion&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now neither the father nor the mother had yet entered
where the children were, but the father sighed heavily because they
were dead, and the mother asked for them, that they might rejoice
together; but Amile said, &lsquo;Dame! let the children
sleep.&rsquo; And it was already the hour of Tierce. And going in
alone to the children to weep over them, he found them at play in
the bed; only, in the place of the sword-cuts about their throats
was, as it were, a thread of crimson. And he took them in his arms
and carried them to his wife and said, &lsquo;Rejoice greatly! For
thy children whom I had slain by the commandment of the angel, are
alive, and by their blood is Amis healed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think you will all see how fine a story this is, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276">[276]</a></span>and feel
the emotional force of the grand moral idea behind it. There is
nothing more to tell you, except the curious fact that during the
Middle Ages, when it was believed that the story was really true,
Amis and Amile&mdash;or Amicus and Amelius&mdash;were actually
considered by the Church as saints, and people used to pray to
them. When anybody was anxious for his friend, or feared that he
might lose the love of his friend, or was afraid that he might not
have strength to perform his duty as friend&mdash;then he would go
to church to implore help from the good saints Amicus and Amelius.
But of course it was all a mistake&mdash;a mistake which lasted
until the end of the seventeenth century! Then somebody called the
attention of the Church to the unmistakable fact that Amicus and
Amelius were merely inventions of some medi&aelig;val romancer.
Then the Church made investigation, and greatly shocked, withdrew
from the list of its saints those long-loved names of Amicus and
Amelius&mdash;a reform in which I cannot help thinking the Church
made a very serious mistake. What matter whether those shadowy
figures represented original human lives or only human dreams? They
were beautiful, and belief in them made men think beautiful
thoughts, and the imagined help from them had comforted many
thousands of hearts. It would have been better to have left them
alone; for that matter, how many of the existent lives of saints
are really true? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name=
"page277">[277]</a></span>Nevertheless the friends are not dead,
though expelled from the heaven of the Church. They still live in
romance; and everybody who reads about them feels a little better
for their acquaintance.</p>
<p>What I read to you was from the French version&mdash;that is
much the more beautiful of the two. You will find some extracts
from the English version in the pages of Ten Brink. But as that
great German scholar pointed out, the English story is much rougher
than the French. For example, in the English story, the knight
rushes out of his castle to beat the leper at the gate, and to
accuse him of having stolen the cup. And he does beat him
ferociously, and abuses him with very violent terms. In fact, the
English writer reflected too much of medi&aelig;val English
character, in trying to cover, or to improve upon, the French
story, which was the first. In the French story all is knightly
smooth, refined as well as simple and strong. And where did the
medi&aelig;val imagination get its material for the story? Partly,
perhaps, from the story of Joseph in the Bible, partly from the
story of Abraham; but the scriptural material is so admirably
worked over that the whole thing appears deliciously original. That
was the great art of the Middle Ages&mdash;to make old, old things
quite new by the magic of spiritual imagination. Men then lived in
a world of dreams. And that world still attracts us, for the simple
reason that happiness chiefly consists in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278">[278]</a></span>dreams.
Exact science may help us a great deal no doubt, but mathematics do
not make us any happier. Dreams do, if we can believe them. The
Middle Ages could believe them; we, at the best, can only try.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Ionica&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I am going now to talk about a very rare kind of poetry in a
very rare little book, like fine wine in a small and precious
flask. The author never put his name to the book&mdash;indeed for
many years it was not known who wrote the volume. We now know that
the author was a school teacher called William Johnson who, later
in life, coming into a small fortune, changed his name to William
Cory. He was born sometime about 1823, and died in 1892. He was, I
believe, an Oxford man and was assistant master of Eton College for
a number of years. Judging from his poems, he must have found
pleasure in his profession as well as pain. There is a strange
sadness nearly always, but this sadness is mixed with expressions
of love for the educational establishment which he directed, and
for the students whose minds he helped to form. He must have been
otherwise a very shy man. Scarcely anything seems to be known about
him after his departure from educational circles, although
everybody of taste now knows his poems. I wish to speak of them
because I think that literary graduates of this university
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name=
"page280">[280]</a></span>ought to be at least familiar with the
name &ldquo;Ionica.&rdquo; At all events you should know something
about the man and about the best of his poems. If you should ask
why so little has yet been said about him in books on English
literature, I would answer that in the first place he was a very
small poet writing in the time of giants, having for competitors
Tennyson, Browning and others. He could scarcely make his small
pipe heard in the thunder of those great organ tones. In the second
place his verses were never written to please the public at all.
They were written only for fine scholars, and even the titles of
many of them cannot be explained by a person devoid of some Greek
culture. So the little book, which appeared quite early in the
Victorian Age, was soon forgotten. Being forgotten it ran out of
print and disappeared. Then somebody remembered that it had
existed. I have told you that it was like the tone of a little pipe
or flute as compared with the organ music of the larger poets. But
the little pipe happened to be a Greek pipe&mdash;the melody was
very sweet and very strange and old, and people who had heard it
once soon wanted to hear it again. But they could not get it.
Copies of the first edition fetched extraordinary sums. Some few
years ago a new edition appeared, but this too is now out of print
and is fetching fancy prices. However, you must not expect anything
too wonderful from this way <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"
name="page281">[281]</a></span>of introducing the subject. The
facts only show that the poems are liked by persons of refinement
and wealth. I hope to make you like some of them, but the
difficulties of so doing are considerable, because of the extremely
English character of some pieces and the extremely Greek tone of
others. There is also some uneven work. The poet is not in all
cases successful. Sometimes he tried to write society verse, and
his society verse must be considered a failure. The best pieces are
his Greek pieces and some compositions on love subjects of a most
delicate and bewitching kind.</p>
<p>Of course the very name &ldquo;Ionica&rdquo; suggests Greek
work, a collection of pieces in Ionic style. But you must not think
that this means only repetitions of ancient subjects. This author
brings the Greek feeling back again into the very heart of English
life sometimes, or makes an English fact illustrate a Greek fable.
Some delightful translations from the Greek there are, but less
than half a dozen in all.</p>
<p>I scarcely know how to begin&mdash;what piece to quote first.
But perhaps the little fancy called &ldquo;Mimnermus in
Church&rdquo; is the best known, and the one which will best serve
to introduce us to the character of Cory. Before quoting it,
however, I must explain the title briefly. Mimnermus was an old
Greek philosopher and poet who thought that all things in the world
are temporary, that all hope of a future life is vain, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name=
"page282">[282]</a></span>there is nothing worth existing for
except love, and that without affection one were better dead. There
are, no doubt, various modern thinkers who tell you much the same
thing, and this little poem exhibits such modern feeling in a Greek
dress. I mean that we have here a picture of a young man, a young
English scholar, listening in church to Christian teaching, but
answering that teaching with the thought of the old Greeks. There
is of course one slight difference; the modern conception of love
is perhaps a little wider in range than that of the old Greeks.
There is more of the ideal in it.</p>

<p>But oh, the very reason why</p>
<p>I clasp them, is because they die.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The preacher has been talking to his congregation about the joys
of Heaven. There, he says, there will be no quarrelling, no
contest, no falsehood, and all evil dispositions will be entirely
changed to good. The poet answers, &ldquo;This world and this life
are full of beauty and of joy for me. I do not want to die, I want
to live. I do not wish to go to that cold region of stars about
which you teach. I only know this world and I find in it warm
hearts and precious affection. You say that this world is a
phantom, unsubstantial, unreal, and that the only reality is above,
in Heaven. To me that Heaven appears but as an awful emptiness. I
shrink from it in terror, and like a child seek for consolation in
human love. It is no use to talk to me about angels until you can
prove to me that angels can feel happier than men. I prefer to
remain with human beings. You say that I ought to wish for higher
things than this world can give, that here minds are unsteady and
weak, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name=
"page284">[284]</a></span>hearts fickle and selfish, and you talk
of souls without sex, imaginary concerts of perfect music, tireless
singing in Heaven, and the pleasure of conversation without speech.
But all the happiness that we know is received from our fellow
beings. I remember the voice of one dead friend with deeper love
and pleasure than any images of Heaven could ever excite in my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last stanza needs no paraphrasing, but it deserves some
comment, for it is the expression of one great difference between
the old Greek feeling in regard to life and death, and all modern
religious feeling on the same subject. You can read through
hundreds of beautiful inscriptions which were placed over the Greek
tombs. They are contained in the Greek Anthology. You will find
there almost nothing about hope of a future life, or about Heaven.
They are not for the most part sad; they are actually joyous in
many cases. You would say that the Greek mind thought thus about
death&mdash;&ldquo;I have had my share of the beauty and the love
of this world, and I am grateful for this enjoyment, and now it is
time to go to sleep.&rdquo; There is actually an inscription to the
effect, &ldquo;I have supped well of the banquet of life.&rdquo;
The Eastern religions, including Christianity, taught that because
everything in the world is uncertain, impermanent, perishable,
therefore we ought not to allow our minds to love worldly things.
But the Greek mind, as expressed by the old epigraphy <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285">[285]</a></span>in the
cemeteries, not less than by the teaching of Mimnermus, took
exactly the opposite view. &ldquo;O children of men, it is because
beauty and pleasure and love and light can last only for a little
while, it is exactly because of this that you should love them. Why
refuse to enjoy the present because it can not last for
ever?&rdquo; And at a much later day the Persian poet Omar took,
you will remember, precisely the same view. You need not think that
it would be wise to accept such teaching for a rule of life, but it
has a certain value as a balance to the other extreme view, that we
should make ourselves miserable in this world with the idea of
being rewarded in another, concerning which we have no positive
knowledge. The lines with which the poem concludes at least deserve
to be thought about&mdash;</p>

<p>We shall later on take some of the purely Greek work of Cory for
study, but I want now to interest you in the more modern part of
it. The charm of the following passage you will better feel by
remembering that the writer was then a schoolmaster at Eton, and
that the verses particularly express the love which he felt for his
students&mdash;a love the more profound, perhaps, because the
circumstances of the teacher&rsquo;s position obliged him to appear
cold and severe, obliged <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286"
name="page286">[286]</a></span>him to suppress natural impulses of
affection and generosity. The discipline of the masters in English
public schools is much more severe than the discipline to which the
students are subjected. The boys enjoy a great deal of liberty. The
masters may be said to have none. Yet there are men so constituted
that they learn to greatly love the profession. The title of this
poem is &ldquo;Reparabo,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;I will
atone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>This comparison of the educator to a falconer, and of the
students to young hawks eager to break their jesses seems to an
Englishman particularly happy in reference to Eton, from which so
many youths pass into the ranks of the army and navy. The line
about bowing, smirking and glozing, refers to the comparative
insincerity of the higher society into which so many of the
scholars must eventually pass. &ldquo;Smirking&rdquo; suggests
insincere smiles, &ldquo;glozing&rdquo; implies tolerating or
lightly passing over faults or wrongs or serious matters that
should not be considered lightly. Society is essentially insincere
and artificial in all countries, but especially so in England. The
old Eton master thinks, however, that he knows the moral character
of the boys, the strong principles which make its foundation, and
he trusts that they will be able in a general way to do only what
is right, in spite of conventions and humbug.</p>
<p>As I told you before, we know very little about the personal
life of Cory, who must have been a very reserved man; but a poet
puts his heart into his verses as a general rule, and there are
many little poems in this book that suggest to us an unhappy love
episode. These are extremely pretty and touching, the writer in
most cases confessing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name=
"page288">[288]</a></span>himself unworthy of the person who
charmed him; but the finest thing of the kind is a composition
which he suggestively entitled &ldquo;A Fable&rdquo;&mdash;that is
to say, a fable in the Greek sense, an emblem or symbol of
truth.</p>

<p class="i2">And snap the harp-strings, one by one;</p>
<p>It was a maiden blithe and kind:</p>
<p class="i2">They felt her touch; their task is done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this charming little study we know that the harp described is
not a harp; it is the loving heart of an old man, at least of a man
beyond the usual age of lovers. He has described and perhaps adored
some beautiful person who seemed to care for him, and who played
upon his heart, with her whims, caresses, smiles, much as one would
play upon the strings of a harp. She did not mean to be cruel at
all, nor even insincere. It is even probable that she really in
those times thought that she loved the man, and under the charms of
the girl the man became a different being; the old-fashioned mind
brightened, the old-fashioned heart exposed its hidden treasures of
tenderness and wisdom and sympathy. Very much like playing upon a
long forgotten instrument, was the relation between the maiden and
the man&mdash;not only because he resembled such an instrument in
the fact of belonging emotionally and intellectually to another
generation, but also because his was a <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page291" name="page291">[291]</a></span>heart whose true music had
long been silent, unheard by the world. Undoubtedly the maiden
meant no harm, but she caused a great deal of pain, for at a later
day, becoming a great lady of society, she forgot all about this
old friendship, or perhaps wondered why she ever wasted her time in
talking to such a strange old-fashioned professor. Then the
affectionate heart is condemned to silence again, to silence and
oblivion, like the harp thrown away in some garret to be covered
with cobwebs and visited only by bats. &ldquo;Is it not
time,&rdquo; the old man thinks, &ldquo;that the strings should be
broken, the strings of the heart? Let the cold wind of death now
come and snap them.&rdquo; Yet, after all, why should he complain?
Did he not have the beautiful experience of loving, and was she not
in that time at least well worthy of the love that she called forth
like music?</p>
<p>There are several other poems referring to what would seem to be
the same experience, and all are beautiful, but one seems to me
nobler than the rest, expressing as it does a generous resignation.
It is called &ldquo;Deteriora,&rdquo; a Latin word signifying
lesser, inferior, or deteriorated things&mdash;not easy to
translate. Nor would you find the poem easy to understand,
referring as it does to conditions of society foreign to anything
in Japanese experience. But some verses which I may quote you will
like.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name=

<p>If fate and nature screen from me</p>
<p class="i2">The sovran front I bowed before,</p>
<p>And set the glorious creature free,</p>
<p class="i2">Whom I would clasp, detain, adore,&mdash;</p>
<p>If I forego that strange delight,</p>
<p>Must all be lost? Not quite, not quite.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><em>Die, Little Love, without complaint,</em></p>
<p class="i2"><em>Whom honour standeth by to shrive:</em></p>

<p class="i2"><em>Die, Love, whom Friendship will survive.</em></p>
<p><em>Not hate nor folly gave thee birth;</em></p>
<p><em>And briefness does but raise thy worth.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the same thought which Tennyson expressed in his famous
lines,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&rsquo;Tis better to have loved and lost</p>
<p>Than never to have loved at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But it is still more finely expressed to meet a particular
personal mood. One must not think the world lost because a woman
has been lost, he says, and such a love is not a thing for any man
to be ashamed of, in spite of the fact that it has been
disappointed. It was honourable, unselfish, not inspired by any
passion or any folly, and the very brevity of the experience only
serves to make it more precious. Observe the use of the words
&ldquo;shrive&rdquo; and &ldquo;assoiled.&rdquo; These refer to the
old religious custom of confession; to &ldquo;shrive&rdquo;
signifies to forgive, to free from sin, as a priest is supposed to
do, and &ldquo;assoiled&rdquo; means &ldquo;purified.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name=
"page293">[293]</a></span>If this was a personal experience, it
must have been an experience of advanced life. Elsewhere the story
of a boyish love is told very prettily, under the title of
&ldquo;Two Fragments of Childhood.&rdquo; This is the first
fragment:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When these locks were yellow as gold,</p>
<p>When past days were easily told,</p>
<p>Well I knew the voice of the sea,</p>
<p>Once he spake as a friend to me.</p>
<p>Thunder-rollings carelessly heard,</p>
<p>Once that poor little heart they stirred,</p>
<p class="i2">Why, Oh, why?</p>
<p class="i2">Memory, memory!</p>
<p>She that I wished to be with was by.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sick was I in those misanthrope days</p>
<p>Of soft caresses, womanly ways;</p>
<p>Once that maid on the stair I met</p>
<p>Lip on brow she suddenly set.</p>
<p>Then flushed up my chivalrous blood,</p>
<p>Like Swiss streams in a mid-summer flood.</p>
<p class="i2">Then, Oh, then,</p>
<p class="i2">Imogen, Imogen!</p>
<p>Hadst thou a lover, whose years were ten.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is evidently the charming memory of a little sick boy sent
to the seaside for his health, according to the English custom, and
unhappy there, unable to play about like stronger children, and
obliged to remain under the constant care of nurses and female
relatives. But in the same house there is another family with a
beautiful <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name=
"page294">[294]</a></span>young daughter, probably sixteen or
eighteen years old. The little boy wishes, wishes so much that the
beautiful lady would speak to him and play with him, but he is shy,
afraid to approach her&mdash;only looks at her with great admiring
loving eyes. But one day she meets him on the stairs, and stoops
down and kisses him on the forehead. Then he is in Heaven.
Afterward no doubt she played with him, and they walked up and down
by the shore of the sea together, and now, though an old man,
whenever he hears the roar of the sea he remembers the beautiful
lady who played with him and caressed him, when he was a little
sick child. How much he loved her! But she was a woman, and he was
only ten years old. The reference to &ldquo;chivalrous blood&rdquo;
signifies just this, that at the moment when she kissed him he
would have given his life for her, would have dared anything or
done anything to show his devotion to her. No prettier memory of a
child could be told.</p>
<p>We can learn a good deal about even the shyest of the poets
through a close understanding of his poetry. From the foregoing we
know that Cory must have been a sickly child; and from other poems
referring to school life we can not escape the supposition that he
was not a strong lad. In one of his verses he speaks of being
unable to join in the hearty play of his comrades; and in the poem
which touches on the life of the mature man we find him
acknowledging that he believed his <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page295" name="page295">[295]</a></span>life a failure&mdash;a
failure through want of strength. I am going to quote this poem for
other reasons. It is a beautiful address either to some favourite
student or to a beloved son&mdash;it is impossible to decide which.
But that does not matter. The title is &ldquo;A New Year&rsquo;s
Day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name=
"page296">[296]</a></span>How beautiful this is, and how profoundly
sad!</p>
<p>I shall return to the personal poetry of Cory later on, but I
want now to give you some examples of his Greek work. Perhaps the
best of this is little more than a rendering of Greek into English;
some of the work is pure translation. But it is the translation of
a very great master, the perfect rendering of Greek feeling as well
as of Greek thought. Here is an example of pure translation:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>They told me, Heraclitus, they told me you were dead,</p>
<p>They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to
shed.</p>
<p>I wept, as I remembered, how often you and I</p>
<p>Had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky.</p>
<p>And now that thou art lying, my dear old Carian guest,</p>
<p>A handful of grey ashes, long, long ago at rest,</p>
<p>Still are thy pleasant voices, thy nightingales, awake;</p>
<p>For Death, he taketh all away, but them he cannot take.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What are &ldquo;thy pleasant voices, thy nightingales&rdquo;?
They are the songs which the dear dead poet made, still sung in his
native country, though his body was burned to ashes long
ago&mdash;has been changed into a mere handful of grey ashes,
which, doubtless, have been placed in an urn, as is done with such
ashes to-day in Japan. Death takes away all things from man, but
not his poems, his songs, the beautiful thoughts which he puts into
musical verse. These will always be heard like <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page297" name=
"page297">[297]</a></span>nightingales. The fourth line in the
first stanza contains an idiom which may not be familiar to you. It
means only that the two friends talked all day until the sun set in
the West, and still talked on after that. Tennyson has used the
same Greek thought in a verse of his poem, &ldquo;A Dream of Fair
Women,&rdquo; where Cleopatra says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;We drank the Libyan sun to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Greek author of the above poem was the great poet
Callimachus, and the English translator does not think it necessary
even to give the name, as he wrote only for folk well acquainted
with the classics. He has another short translation which he
accompanies with the original Greek text; it is very pretty, but of
an entirely different kind, a kind that may remind you of some
Japanese poems. It is only about a cicada and a peasant girl, and
perhaps it is twenty-four or twenty-five hundred years old.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A dry cicale chirps to a lass making hay,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why creak&rsquo;st thou, Tithonus?&rdquo; quoth she.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play;</p>
<p>It doubles my toil, your importunate lay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve earned a sweet pillow, lo! Hesper is nigh;</p>
<p>I clasp a good wisp and in fragrance I lie;</p>
<p>But thou art unwearied, and empty, and dry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>How very human this little thing is&mdash;how actually it brings
before us the figure of the girl, who must <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298">[298]</a></span>have
become dust some time between two and three thousand years ago! She
is working hard in the field, and the constant singing of the
insect prompts her to make a comical protest. &ldquo;Oh, Tithonus,
what are you making that creaking noise for? You old dry thing, I
have no time to play with you, or to idle in any way, but you do
nothing but complain. Why don&rsquo;t you work, as I do? Soon I
shall have leave to sleep, because I have worked well. There is the
evening star, and I shall have a good bed of hay, sweet-smelling
fresh hay, to lie upon. How well I shall sleep. But you, you idle
noisy thing, you do not deserve to sleep. You have done nothing to
tire you. And you are empty, dry and thirsty. Serves you
right!&rdquo; Of course you recognize the allusion to the story of
Tithonus, so beautifully told by Tennyson. The girl&rsquo;s jest
has a double meaning. The word &ldquo;importunate&rdquo; has the
signification of a wearisome repetition of a request, a constant
asking, impossible to satisfy. Tithonus was supposed to complain
because he was obliged to live although he wanted to die. That
young girl does not want to die at all. And she says that the noise
of the insect, supposed to repeat the complaint of Tithonus, only
makes it more tiresome for her to work. She was feeling, no doubt,
much as a Japanese student would feel when troubled by the singing
of <em>semi</em> on some very hot afternoon while he is trying to
master some difficult problem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name=
"page299">[299]</a></span>That is pure Greek&mdash;pure as another
mingling of the Greek feeling with the modern scholarly spirit,
entitled &ldquo;An Invocation.&rdquo; Before quoting from it I must
explain somewhat; otherwise you might not be able to imagine what
it means, because it was written to be read by those only who are
acquainted with Theocritus and the Greek idylists. Perhaps I had
better say something too, about the word idyl, for the use of the
word by Tennyson is not the Greek use at all, except in the mere
fact that the word signifies a picturing, a shadowing or an
imagining of things. Tennyson&rsquo;s pictures are of a purely
imaginative kind in the &ldquo;Idyls of the King.&rdquo; But the
Greek poets who first invented the poetry called idyllic did not
attempt the heroic works of imagination at all; they only
endeavoured to make perfectly true pictures of the common life of
peasants in the country. They wrote about the young men and young
girls working on the farms, about the way they quarrelled or
rejoiced or made love, about their dances and their songs, about
their religious festivals and their sacrifices to the gods at the
parish temple. Imagine a Japanese scholar of to-day who, after
leaving the university, instead of busying himself with the
fashionable studies of the time, should go out into the remoter
districts or islands of Japan, and devote his life to studying the
existence of the commoner people there, and making poems about it.
This was exactly what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name=
"page300">[300]</a></span>the Greek idylists did,&mdash;that is,
the best of them. They were great scholars and became friends of
kings, but they wrote poetry chiefly about peasant life, and they
gave all their genius to the work. The result was so beautiful that
everybody is still charmed by the pictures or idyls which they
made.</p>
<p>Well, after this disgression, to return to the subject of
Theocritus, the greatest of the idylists. He has often introduced
into his idyls the name of Comatas. Who was Comatas? Comatas was a
Greek shepherd boy, or more strictly speaking a goatherd, who kept
the flocks of a rich man. It was his duty to sacrifice to the gods
none of his master&rsquo;s animals, without permission; but as his
master was a very avaricious person, Comatas knew that it would be
of little use to ask him. Now this Comatas was a very good singer
of peasant songs, and he made many beautiful poems for the people
to sing, and he believed that it was the gods who had given him
power to make the songs, and the Muses had inspired him with the
capacity to make good verse. In spite of his master&rsquo;s will,
Comatas therefore thought it was not very bad to take the young
kids and sacrifice to the gods and the Muses. When his master found
out what had been done with the animals, naturally he became very
angry, and he put Comatas into a great box of cedar-wood in order
to starve him to death&mdash;saying, as he closed and locked the
lid, &ldquo;Now, Comatas, let us see whether the gods <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301">[301]</a></span>will feed
you!&rdquo; In that box Comatas was left for a year without food or
drink, and when the master, at the end of the year, opened the box,
he expected to find nothing but the bones of the goatherd. But
Comatas was alive and well, singing sweet songs, because during the
year the Muses had sent bees to feed him with honey. The bees had
been able to enter the box through a very little hole. I suppose
you know that bees were held sacred to the Muses, and that there is
in Greek legend a symbolic relation between bees and poetry.</p>
<p>If you want to know what kind of songs Comatas sang and what
kind of life he represented, you will find all this exquisitely
told by Theocritus; and there is a beautiful little translation in
prose of Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, made by Andrew Lang, which
should delight you to read. Another day I shall give you examples
of such translations. Then you will see what true idyllic poetry
originally signified. These Greeks, although trained scholars and
philosophers, understood not only that human nature in itself is a
beautiful thing, but also that the best way to study human nature
is to study the life of the peasants and the common people. It is
not to the rich and leisurely, not to rank and society, that a poet
must go for inspiration. He will not find it there. What is called
society is a world in which nobody is happy, and in which pure
human nature is afraid <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name=
"page302">[302]</a></span>to show itself. Life among the higher
classes in all countries is formal, artificial, theatrical; poetry
is not there. Of course no kind of human community is perfectly
happy, but it is among the simple folk, the country folk, who do
not know much about evil and deceit, that the greater proportion of
happiness can be found. Among the youths of the country especially,
combining the charm of childhood with the strength of adult
maturity, the best possible subjects for fine pure studies of human
nature can be found. May I not here express the hope that some
young Japanese poet, some graduate of this very university, will
eventually attempt to do in Japan what Theocritus and Bion did in
ancient Sicily? A great deal of the very same kind of poetry exists
in our own rural districts, and parallels can be found in the daily
life of the Japanese peasants for everything beautifully described
in Theocritus. At all events I am quite sure of one thing, that no
great new literature can possibly arise in this country until some
scholarly minds discover that the real force and truth and beauty
and poetry of life is to be found only in studies of the common
people&mdash;not in the life of the rich and the noble, not in the
shadowy life of books.</p>
<p>Well, our English poet felt with the Greek idylists, and in the
poem called &ldquo;An Invocation&rdquo; he beautifully expresses
this sympathy. All of us, he says, should like to see and hear
something of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name=
"page303">[303]</a></span>the ancient past if it were possible. We
should like, some of us, to call back the vanished gods and
goddesses of the beautiful Greek world, or to talk to the great
souls of that world who had the experience of life as men&mdash;to
Socrates, for example, to Plato, to Phidias the sculptor, to
Pericles the statesman. But, as a poet, my wish would not be for
the return of the old gods nor of the old heroes so much as for the
return to us of some common men who lived in the Greek world. It is
Comatas, he says, that he would most like to see, and to see in
some English park&mdash;in the neighbourhood of Cambridge
University, or of Eton College. And thus he addresses the spirit of
Comatas:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>O dear divine Comatas, I would that thou and I</p>
<p>Beneath this broken sunlight this leisure day might lie;</p>
<p>Where trees from distant forests, whose names were strange to
thee,</p>
<p>Should bend their amorous branches within thy reach to be,</p>
<p>And flowers thine Hellas knew not, which art hath made more
fair,</p>
<p>Should shed their shining petals upon thy fragrant hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then thou shouldst calmly listen with ever-changing looks</p>
<p>To songs of younger minstrels and plots of modern books,</p>
<p>And wonder at the daring of poets later born,</p>
<p>Whose thoughts are unto thy thoughts as noontide is to morn;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name=
"page304">[304]</a></span>
<p>And little shouldst them grudge them their greater strength of
soul,</p>
<p>Thy partners in the torch-race, though nearer to the goal.</p>
</div>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="stanza">
<p>Or in thy cedarn prison thou waitest for the bee:</p>
<p>Ah, leave that simple honey and take thy food from me.</p>
<p>My sun is stooping westward. Entranced dreamer, haste;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fruitage in my garden that I would have thee
taste.</p>
<p>Now lift the lid a moment; now, Dorian shepherd, speak;</p>
<p>Two minds shall flow together, the English and the Greek.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A few phrases of these beautiful stanzas need explanation.
&ldquo;Broken sunlight&rdquo; refers, of course, to the imperfect
shade thrown by the trees under which the poet is lying. The shadow
is broken by the light passing through leaves, or conversely, the
light is broken by the interposition of the leaves. The reference
to trees from distant forests no doubt intimates that the poet is
in some botanical garden, a private park, in which foreign trees
are carefully cultivated. The &ldquo;torch race&rdquo; is a simile
for the pursuit of knowledge and truth. Greek thinkers compare the
transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, to the
passing of a lighted torch from hand to hand, as in the case of
messengers carrying signals or athletes running a mighty race. As a
runner runs until he is tired, or until he reaches the next
station, and then passes the torch which he has been <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305">[305]</a></span>carrying
to another runner waiting to receive it, so does each generation
pass on its wisdom to the succeeding generation, and disappear.
&ldquo;My sun is stooping westward&rdquo; is only a beautiful way
of saying, &ldquo;I am becoming very old; be quick, so that we may
see each other before I die.&rdquo; And the poet suggests that it
is because of his age and his experience and his wisdom that he
could hope to be of service to the dear divine Comatas. The
expression, &ldquo;there is fruitage in my garden,&rdquo; refers to
no material garden, but to the cultivated mind of the scholar; he
is only saying, &ldquo;I have strange knowledge that I should like
to impart to you.&rdquo; How delightful, indeed, it would be, could
some university scholar really converse with a living Greek of the
old days!</p>
<p>There is another little Greek study of great and simple beauty
entitled &ldquo;The Daughter of Cleomenes.&rdquo; It is only an
historical incident, but it is so related for the pleasure of
suggesting a profound truth about the instinct of childhood. Long
ago, when the Persians were about to make an attack upon the
Greeks, there was an attempt to buy off the Spartan resistance, and
the messenger to the Spartan general found him playing with his
little daughter, a child of six or seven. The conference was
carried on in whispers, and the child could not hear what was being
said; but she broke up the whole plot by a single word. I shall
quote a few lines from the close of the poem, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306">[306]</a></span>which
contain its moral lessons. The emissary has tried to tempt him with
promises of wealth and power.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He falters; for the waves he fears,</p>
<p class="i2">The roads he cannot measure;</p>
<p>But rates full high the gleam of spears</p>
<p class="i2">And dreams of yellow treasure.</p>
<p>He listens; he is yielding now;</p>
<p class="i2">Outspoke the fearless child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, come away, lest thou</p>
<p class="i2">Be by this man beguiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lowly judgment barred the plea,</p>
<p class="i2">So low, it could not reach her.</p>
<p><em>The man knows more of land and sea,</em></p>
<p class="i2"><em>But she&rsquo;s the truer teacher.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All the little girl could know about the matter was instinctive;
she only saw the cunning face of the stranger, and felt sure that
he was trying to deceive her father for a bad purpose&mdash;so she
cried out, &ldquo;Father, come away with me, or else that man will
deceive you.&rdquo; And she spoke truth, as her father immediately
recognized.</p>
<p>There are several more classical studies of extraordinary
beauty; but your interest in them would depend upon something more
than interest in Greek and Roman history, and we can not study all
the poems. So I prefer to go back to the meditative lyrics, and to
give a few splendid examples of these more personal compositions.
The following stanzas are from a poem whose Latin <span class=

the equal of Tennyson as a master of language.</p>

<p>Very possibly this charming meditation was written on the Welsh
coast; there is just such scenery as the poem describes, and the
grand peak of Snowdon would well realize the imagination of the
line about the girlhood of the growing hills. The melancholy of the
latter part of the composition is the same melancholy to be found
in &ldquo;Mimnermus in Church,&rdquo; the first of Cory&rsquo;s
poems which we read together. It is the Greek teaching that there
is nothing to console us for the great doubt and mystery of
existence except unselfish affection. All through the book we find
the same philosophy, even in the beautiful studies of student life
and the memories of childhood. So it is quite a melancholy book,
though the sadness be beautiful. I have given you examples of the
sadness of doubt and of the sadness of love; but there is yet a
third kind of sadness&mdash;the sadness of a childless man, wishing
that he could have a child of his own. It is a very pretty thing,
simply entitled &ldquo;Scheveningen Avenue&rdquo;&mdash;probably
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name=
"page309">[309]</a></span>name of the avenue where the incident
occurred. The poet does not tell us how it occurred, but we can
very well guess. He was riding in a street car, probably, and a
little girl next to him, while sitting upon her nurse&rsquo;s lap,
fell asleep, and as she slept let her head fall upon his shoulder.
This is a very simple thing to make a poem about, but what a poem
it is!</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>There is an almost intolerable acuity of sadness in the last two
mocking verses, but how pretty and how tender the whole thing is,
and how gentle-hearted must have been the man who wrote it! The
same tenderness reappears in references to children of a larger
growth, the boys of his school. Sometimes he very much regrets the
necessity of discipline, and advocates a wiser method of dealing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name=

</div>
</div>
<p>But a little reflection further on in the same poem reminds us
how necessary the discipline must be for the battle of life,
inasmuch as each of those charming boys will have to fight against
evil&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>One might easily lecture about this little volume for many more
days, so beautiful are the things which fill it. But enough has
been cited to exemplify its unique value. If you reread these
quotations, I think you will find each time new beauty in them. And
the beauty is quite peculiar. Such poetry could have been written
only under two conditions. The first is that the poet be a
consummate scholar. The second is that he must have suffered, as
only a great mind and heart could suffer, from want of
affection.</p>

<h3><a id="Ch_15" name="Ch_15">Chapter XV</a></h3>
<h2>Old Greek Fragments</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The other day when we were reading some of the poems in
&ldquo;Ionica,&rdquo; I promised to speak in another short essay of
Theocritus and his songs or idyls of Greek peasant life, but in
speaking of him it will be well also to speak of others who equally
illustrate the fact that everywhere there is truth and beauty for
the mind that can see. I spoke last week about what I thought the
highest possible kind of literary art might become. But the
possible becoming is yet far away; and in speaking of some old
Greek writers I want only to emphasize the fact that modern
literary art as well as ancient literary art produced their best
results from a close study of human nature.</p>
<p>Although Theocritus and others who wrote idyls found their chief
inspiration in the life of the peasants, they sometimes also wrote
about the life of cities. Human nature may be studied in the city
as well as in the country, provided that a man knows how to look
for it. It is not in the courts of princes nor the houses of nobles
nor the residences of the wealthy that such study can be made.
These superior classes have found it necessary <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313">[313]</a></span>to show
themselves to the world very cautiously; they live by rule, they
conceal their emotions, they move theatrically. But the ordinary,
everyday people of cities are very different; they speak their
thoughts, they keep their hearts open, and they let us see, just as
children do, the good or the evil side of their characters. So a
good poet and a good observer can find in the life of cities
subjects of study almost as easily as in the country. Theocritus
has done this in his fifteenth idyl. This idyl is very famous, and
it has been translated hundreds of times into various languages.
Perhaps you may have seen one version of it which was made by
Matthew Arnold. But I think that the version made by Lang is even
better.</p>
<p>The scene is laid in Alexandria, probably some two thousand
years ago, and the occasion is a religious holiday&mdash;a
<em>matsuri</em>, as we call it in Japan. Two women have made an
appointment to go together to the temple, to see the festival and
to see the people. The poet begins his study by introducing us to
the chamber of one of the women.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gorgo.</span> &ldquo;Is Praxinoe at
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Praxinoe.</span> &ldquo;Dear Gorgo, how long is
it since you have been here! She is at home. The wonder is that you
have got here at last! Eunoe, come and see that she has a chair and
put a cushion on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>G. &ldquo;It does most charmingly as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name=
"page314">[314]</a></span> P. &ldquo;Do sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How natural this is. There is nothing Greek about it any more
than there is Japanese; it is simply human. It is something that
happens in Tokyo every day, certainly in houses where there are
chairs and where it is a custom to put a cushion on the chair for
the visitor. But remember, this was two thousand years ago. Now
listen to what the visitor has to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have scarcely got to you at all, Praxinoe! What a huge
crowd, what hosts of carriages! Everywhere cavalry boots,
everywhere men in uniform! And the road is endless; yes, you really
live too far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Praxinoe answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all for that mad man of mine. Here he came to the
ends of the earth and took a hall, not a house, and all that we
might not be neighbours. The jealous wretch, always the same, ever
for spite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is speaking half in jest, half in earnest; but she forgets
that her little boy is present, and the visitor reminds her of the
fact:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of your husband like that, my dear girl,
before the little boy,&mdash;look how he is staring at
you!&mdash;Never mind, Zaphyrion, sweet child, she is not speaking
about papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. &ldquo;Our Lady! (Persephone) The child takes
notice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the visitor to comfort the child says &ldquo;Nice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name=
"page315">[315]</a></span>papa,&rdquo; and the conversation
proceeds. The two talk about their husbands, about their dresses,
about the cost of things in the shops; but in order to see the
festival Praxinoe must dress herself quickly, and woman, two
thousand years ago, just as now, takes a long time to dress. Hear
Praxinoe talking to her maid-servant while she hurries to get
ready:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eunoe, bring the water and put it down in the middle of
the room,&mdash;lazy creature that you are. Cat-like, always trying
to sleep soft! Come, bustle, bring the water; quicker! I want water
first,&mdash;and how she carries it! Give it me all the
same;&mdash;don&rsquo;t pour out so much, you extravagant thing!
Stupid girl! Why are you wetting my dress? There, stop, I have
washed my hands as heaven would have it. Where is the key of the
big chest? Bring it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is life, natural and true; we can see those three together,
the girlish young wife hurrying and scolding and chattering
naturally and half childishly, the patient servant girl smiling at
the hurry of her mistress, and the visitor looking at her
friend&rsquo;s new dress, wondering how much it cost and presently
asking her the price. At last all is ready. But the little boy sees
his mother go out and he wants to go out too, though it has been
decided not to take him, because the crowd is too rough and he
might be hurt. Here the mother first explains, then speaks
firmly:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name=
"page316">[316]</a></span>&ldquo;No, child, I don&rsquo;t mean to
take you. Boo! Bogies! There is a horse that bites! Cry as much as
you please, but I cannot have you maimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go out, Praxinoe and Gorgo and the maid-servant Eunoe. The
crowd is tremendous, and they find it very hard to advance.
Sometimes there are horses in the way, sometimes wagons,
occasionally a legion of cavalry. We know all this, because we hear
the chatter of the women as they make their way through the
press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand, and you, Eunoe, catch hold of
Eutychis,&mdash;for fear lest you get lost&hellip;. Here come the
kings on horses! My dear man, don&rsquo;t trample on me. Eunoe, you
fool-hardy girl, will you never keep out of the way? Oh! How
tiresome, Gorgo, my muslin veil is torn in two already&hellip;. For
heaven&rsquo;s sake, sir, if you ever wish to be fortunate, take
care of my shawl!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stranger.</span> &ldquo;I can hardly help
myself, but for all that I will be as helpful as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange man helps the women and children through the pushing
crowd, and they thank him very prettily, praying that he may have
good fortune all his life. But not all the strangers who come in
contact with them happen to be so kind. They come at last into that
part of the temple ground where the image of Adonis is displayed;
the beauty of the statue moves them, and they <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317">[317]</a></span>utter
exclamations of delight. This does not please some of the male
spectators, one of whom exclaims, &ldquo;You tiresome women, do
cease your endless cooing talk! They bore one to death with their
eternal broad vowels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are country women, and their critic is probably a
purist&mdash;somebody who has studied Greek as it is pronounced and
spoken in Athens. But the women bravely resent this interference
with their rights.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gorgo.</span> &ldquo;Indeed! And where may this
person come from? What is it to you if we are chatterboxes? Give
orders to your own servants, sir. Do you pretend to command the
ladies of Syracuse? If you must know, we are Corinthians by
descent, like Bellerophon himself, and we speak Peloponnesian.
Dorian women may lawfully speak Doric, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is enough to silence the critic, but the other young woman
also turns upon him, and we may suppose that he is glad to escape
from their tongues. And then everybody becomes silent, for the
religious services begin. The priestess, a comely girl, chants the
psalm of Adonis, the beautiful old pagan hymn, more beautiful and
more sensuous than anything uttered by the later religious poets of
the West; and all listen in delighted stillness. As the hymn ends,
Gorgo bursts out in exclamation of praise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praxinoe! The woman is cleverer than we <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318">[318]</a></span>fancied!
Happy woman to know so much!&mdash;Thrice happy to have so sweet a
voice! Well, all the same, it is time to be making for home;
Diocleides has not had his dinner, and the man is all
vinegar,&mdash;don&rsquo;t venture near him when he is kept waiting
for dinner. Farewell, beloved Adonis&mdash;may you find us glad at
your next coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this natural mingling of the sentimental and the
commonplace the little composition ends. It is as though we were
looking through some window into the life of two thousand years
ago. Read the whole thing over to yourselves when you have time to
find the book in the library, and see how true to human nature it
is. There is nothing in it except the wonderful hymn, which does
not belong to to-day as much as to the long ago, to modern Tokyo as
much as to ancient Greece. That is what makes the immortality of
any literary production&mdash;not simply truth to the life of one
time, but truth to the life of every time and place.</p>
<p>Not many years ago there was discovered a book by Herodas, a
Greek writer of about the same period. It is called the
&ldquo;Mimes,&rdquo; a series of little dramatic studies picturing
the life of the time. One of these is well worthy of rank with the
idyl of Theocritus above mentioned. It is the study of a
conversation between a young woman and an old woman. The young
woman has a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name=
"page319">[319]</a></span>husband, who left her to join a military
expedition and has not been heard of for several years. The old
woman is a go-between, and she comes to see the young person on
behalf of another young man, who admires her. But as soon as she
states the nature of her errand, the young lady becomes very angry
and feigns much virtuous indignation. There is a quarrel. Then the
two become friends, and we know that the old woman&rsquo;s coming
is likely to bring about the result desired. Now the wonder of this
little study also is the play of emotion which it reveals. Such
emotions are common to all ages of humanity; we feel the freshness
of this reflection as we read, to such a degree that we cannot
think of the matter as having happened long ago. Yet even the city
in which these episodes took place has vanished from the face of
the earth.</p>
<p>In the case of the studies of peasant life, there is also value
of another kind. Here we have not only studies of human nature, but
studies of particular social conditions. The quarrels of peasants,
half good natured and nearly always happily ending; their account
of their sorrows; their gossip about their work in the
fields&mdash;all this might happen almost anywhere and at almost
any time. But the song contest, the prize given for the best
composition upon a chosen subject, this is particularly Greek, and
has never perhaps existed outside of some place among the peasant
folk. It was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name=
"page320">[320]</a></span>the poetical side of this Greek life of
the peasants, as recorded by Theocritus, which so much influenced
the literatures of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in
France and in England. But neither in France nor in England has
there ever really been, at any time, any life resembling that
portrayed by Theocritus; to-day nothing appears to us more absurd
than the eighteenth century habit of picturing the Greek shepherd
life in English or French landscapes. What really may have existed
among the shepherds of the antique world could not possibly exist
in modern times. But how pretty it is! I think that the tenth idyl
of Theocritus is perhaps the prettiest example of the whole series,
thirty in number, which have been preserved for us. The plan is of
the simplest. Two young peasants, respectively named Battus and
Milon, meeting together in the field, talk about their sweethearts.
One of them works lazily and is jeered by the other in consequence.
The subject of the jeering acknowledges that he works badly because
his mind is disturbed&mdash;he has fallen in love. Then the other
expresses sympathy for him, and tells him that the best thing he
can do to cheer himself up will be to make a song about the girl,
and to sing it as he works. Then he makes a song, which has been
the admiration of the world for twenty centuries and lifts been
translated into almost every language possessing a literature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name=

gracious Bombyca, and lean, and sunburnt;&mdash;&rsquo;tis only I
that call thee honey-pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, and the violet is swart and swart the lettered
hyacinth; but yet these flowers are chosen the first in
garlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goat runs after cytisus, the wolf pursues the goat,
the crane follows the plough,&mdash;but I am wild for love of
thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it were mine, all the wealth whereof Croesus was
lord, as men tell! Then images of us, all in gold, should be
dedicated to Aphrodite, thou with thy flute, and a rose, yea, or an
apple, and I in fair attire and new shoon of Amyclae on both my
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, gracious Bombyca, thy feet are fashioned like carven
ivory, thy voice is drowsy sweet, and thy ways&mdash;I can not tell
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even through the disguise of an English prose translation, you
will see how pretty and how simple this little song must have been
in the Greek, and how very natural is the language of it. Our young
peasant has fallen in love with the girl who is employed to play
the flute for the reapers, as the peasants like to work to the
sound of music. His comrades do not much admire Bombyca; one calls
her &ldquo;a long grasshopper of a girl&rdquo;; another finds her
too thin; a third calls her a gipsy, such a dark brown her skin has
become by constant exposure to the summer sun. And the lover,
looking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name=
"page322">[322]</a></span>at her, is obliged to acknowledge in his
own mind that she is long and lean and dark and like a gipsy; but
he finds beauty in all these characteristics, nevertheless. What if
she is dark? The sweetest honey is darkish, like amber, and so are
beautiful flowers, the best of all flowers, flowers given to
Aphrodite; and the sacred hyacinth on whose leaves appear the
letters of the word of lamentation &ldquo;Ai! Ai!&rdquo;&mdash;that
is also dark like Bombyca. Her darkness is that of honey and
flowers. What a charming apology! He cannot deny that she is long
and lean, and he remains silent on these points, but here we must
all sympathize with him. He shows good taste. It is the tall
slender girl that is really the most beautiful and the most
graceful, not the large-limbed, strong-bodied peasant type that his
companions would prefer. Without knowing it, he has fallen in love
like an artist. And he is not blind to the, grace of slenderness
and of form, though he cannot express it in artistic language. He
can only compare the shape of the girl&rsquo;s feet to the ivory
feet of the divinities in the temples&mdash;perhaps he is thinking
of some ivory image of Aphrodite which he has seen. But how
charming an image does he make to arise before us! Beautiful is the
description of the girl&rsquo;s voice as &ldquo;drowsy
sweet.&rdquo; But the most exquisite thing in the whole song is the
final despairing admission that he can not describe her at
all&mdash;&ldquo;and thy ways, I can not tell of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page323" name=
"page323">[323]</a></span>them&rdquo;! This is one of the most
beautiful expressions in any poem ancient or modern, because of its
supreme truth. What mortal ever could describe the charm of manner,
voice, smile, address, in mere words? Such things are felt, they
can not be described; and the peasant boy reaches the highest
height of true lyrical poetry when he cries out &ldquo;I can not
tell of them.&rdquo; The great French critic Sainte-Beuve attempted
to render this line as follows&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Quant &agrave; ta
mani&egrave;re, je ne puis la rendre!&rdquo;</em> This is very
good; and you can take your choice between it and any English
translation. But good judges say that nothing in English of French
equals the charm of the original.</p>
<p>You will find three different classes of idyls in Theocritus;
the idyl which is a simple song of peasant life, a pure lyric
expressing only a single emotion; the idyl which is a little story,
usually a story about the gods or heroes; and lastly, the idyl
which is presented in the form of a dialogue, or even of a
conversation between three or four persons. All these forms of
idyl, but especially the first and the third, were afterward
beautifully imitated by the Roman poets; then very imperfectly
imitated by modern poets. The imitation still goes on, but the very
best English poets have never really been able to give us anything
worthy of Theocritus himself.</p>
<p>However, this study of the Greek model has given some terms to
English literature which every <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page324" name="page324">[324]</a></span>student ought to know. One
of these terms is amoeb&aelig;an,&mdash;amoeb&aelig;an poetry being
dialogue poetry composed in the form of question and reply. The
original Greek signification was that of alternate speaking. Please
do not forget the word. You may often find it in critical studies
in essays upon contemporary literature; and when you see it again,
remember Theocritus and the school of Greek poets who first
introduced the charm of amoeb&aelig;an poetry. I hope that this
little lecture will interest some of you in Theocritus sufficiently
to induce you to read him carefully through and through. But
remember that you can not get the value of even a single poem of
his at a single reading. We have become so much accustomed to
conventional forms of literature that the simple art of poetry like
this quite escapes us at first sight. We have to read it over and
over again many times, and to think about it; then only we feel the
wonderful charm.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
